  achilles' wrath, to greece the direful spring
  of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!
  that wrath which hurl'd to pluto's gloomy reign
  the souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain
  whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
  devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
  since great achilles and atrides strove,
  such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of jove!
  declare, o muse! in what ill-fated hour
  sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power
  latona's son a dire contagion spread,
  and heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead
  the king of men his reverent priest defied,
  and for the king's offence the people died.
  for chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
  his captive daughter from the victor's chain.
  suppliant the venerable father stands
  apollo's awful ensigns grace his hands
  by these he begs  and lowly bending down,
  extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
  he sued to all, but chief implored for grace
  the brother-kings, of atreus' royal race
   ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown'd,
  and troy's proud walls lie level with the ground.
  may jove restore you when your toils are o'er
  safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
  but, oh! relieve a wretched parent's pain,
  and give chryseis to these arms again
  if mercy fail, yet let my presents move,
  and dread avenging phoebus, son of jove.
  the greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,
  the priest to reverence, and release the fair.
  not so atrides  he, with kingly pride,
  repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied
   hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,
  nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains
  hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,
  nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
  mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain
  and prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain
  till time shall rifle every youthful grace,
  and age dismiss her from my cold embrace,
  in daily labours of the loom employ'd,
  or doom'd to deck the bed she once enjoy'd
  hence then  to argos shall the maid retire,
  far from her native soil and weeping sire.
  the trembling priest along the shore return'd,
  and in the anguish of a father mourn'd.
  disconsolate, not daring to complain,
  silent he wander'd by the sounding main
  till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,
  the god who darts around the world his rays.
   o smintheus! sprung from fair latona's line,
  thou guardian power of cilla the divine,
  thou source of light! whom tenedos adores,
  and whose bright presence gilds thy chrysa's shores.
  if e'er with wreaths i hung thy sacred fane,
  or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain
  god of the silver bow! thy shafts employ,
  avenge thy servant, and the greeks destroy.
  thus chryses pray'd.--the favouring power attends,
  and from olympus' lofty tops descends.
  bent was his bow, the grecian hearts to wound
  fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.
  breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,
  and gloomy darkness roll'd about his head.
  the fleet in view, he twang'd his deadly bow,
  and hissing fly the feather'd fates below.
  on mules and dogs the infection first began
  and last, the vengeful arrows fix'd in man.
  for nine long nights, through all the dusky air,
  the pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.
  but ere the tenth revolving day was run,
  inspired by juno, thetis' godlike son
  convened to council all the grecian train
  for much the goddess mourn'd her heroes slain.
  the assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,
  achilles thus the king of men address'd
   why leave we not the fatal trojan shore,
  and measure back the seas we cross'd before?
  the plague destroying whom the sword would spare,
  'tis time to save the few remains of war.
  but let some prophet, or some sacred sage,
  explore the cause of great apollo's rage
  or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove
  by mystic dreams, for dreams descend from jove.
  if broken vows this heavy curse have laid,
  let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.
  so heaven, atoned, shall dying greece restore,
  and phoebus dart his burning shafts no more.
  he said, and sat  when chalcas thus replied
  chalcas the wise, the grecian priest and guide,
  that sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,
  the past, the present, and the future knew
  uprising slow, the venerable sage
  thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age
   beloved of jove, achilles! would'st thou know
  why angry phoebus bends his fatal bow?
  first give thy faith, and plight a prince's word
  of sure protection, by thy power and sword
  for i must speak what wisdom would conceal,
  and truths, invidious to the great, reveal,
  bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,
  instruct a monarch where his error lies
  for though we deem the short-lived fury past,
  'tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.
  to whom pelides -- from thy inmost soul
  speak what thou know'st, and speak without control.
  e'en by that god i swear who rules the day,
  to whom thy hands the vows of greece convey.
  and whose bless'd oracles thy lips declare
  long as achilles breathes this vital air,
  no daring greek, of all the numerous band,
  against his priest shall lift an impious hand
  not e'en the chief by whom our hosts are led,
  the king of kings, shall touch that sacred head.
  encouraged thus, the blameless man replies
   nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,
  but he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,
  apollo's vengeance for his injured priest.
  nor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,
  but plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,
  till the great king, without a ransom paid,
  to her own chrysa send the black-eyed maid.
  perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,
  the priest may pardon, and the god may spare.
  the prophet spoke  when with a gloomy frown
  the monarch started from his shining throne
  black choler fill'd his breast that boil'd with ire,
  and from his eye-balls flash'd the living fire
   augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,
  prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!
  still must that tongue some wounding message bring,
  and still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?
  for this are phoebus' oracles explored,
  to teach the greeks to murmur at their lord?
  for this with falsehood is my honour stain'd,
  is heaven offended, and a priest profaned
  because my prize, my beauteous maid, i hold,
  and heavenly charms prefer to proffer'd gold?
  a maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,
  skill'd in each art, and crown'd with every grace
  not half so dear were clytaemnestra's charms,
  when first her blooming beauties bless'd my arms.
  yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail
  our cares are only for the public weal
  let me be deem'd the hateful cause of all,
  and suffer, rather than my people fall.
  the prize, the beauteous prize, i will resign,
  so dearly valued, and so justly mine.
  but since for common good i yield the fair,
  my private loss let grateful greece repair
  nor unrewarded let your prince complain,
  that he alone has fought and bled in vain.
   insatiate king  achilles thus replies ,
  fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!
  would'st thou the greeks their lawful prey should yield,
  the due reward of many a well-fought field?
  the spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,
  we share with justice, as with toil we gain
  but to resume whate'er thy avarice craves
   that trick of tyrants  may be borne by slaves.
  yet if our chief for plunder only fight,
  the spoils of ilion shall thy loss requite,
  whene'er, by jove's decree, our conquering powers
  shall humble to the dust her lofty towers.
  then thus the king   shall i my prize resign
  with tame content, and thou possess'd of thine?
  great as thou art, and like a god in fight,
  think not to rob me of a soldier's right.
  at thy demand shall i restore the maid?
  first let the just equivalent be paid
  such as a king might ask  and let it be
  a treasure worthy her, and worthy me.
  or grant me this, or with a monarch's claim
  this hand shall seize some other captive dame.
  the mighty ajax shall his prize resign
  ulysses' spoils, or even thy own, be mine.
  the man who suffers, loudly may complain
  and rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.
  but this when time requires.--it now remains
  we launch a bark to plough the watery plains,
  and waft the sacrifice to chrysa's shores,
  with chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.
  soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,
  and some deputed prince the charge attend
  this creta's king, or ajax shall fulfil,
  or wise ulysses see perform'd our will
  or, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,
  achilles' self conduct her o'er the main
  let fierce achilles, dreadful in his rage,
  the god propitiate, and the pest assuage.
  at this, pelides, frowning stern, replied
   o tyrant, arm'd with insolence and pride!
  inglorious slave to interest, ever join'd
  with fraud, unworthy of a royal mind!
  what generous greek, obedient to thy word,
  shall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?
  what cause have i to war at thy decree?
  the distant trojans never injured me
  to phthia's realms no hostile troops they led
  safe in her vales my warlike coursers fed
  far hence removed, the hoarse-resounding main,
  and walls of rocks, secure my native reign,
  whose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,
  rich in her fruits, and in her martial race.
  hither we sail'd, a voluntary throng,
  to avenge a private, not a public wrong
  what else to troy the assembled nations draws,
  but thine, ungrateful, and thy brother's cause?
  is this the pay our blood and toils deserve
  disgraced and injured by the man we serve?
  and darest thou threat to snatch my prize away,
  due to the deeds of many a dreadful day?
  a prize as small, o tyrant! match'd with thine,
  as thy own actions if compared to mine.
  thine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,
  though mine the sweat and danger of the day.
  some trivial present to my ships i bear
  or barren praises pay the wounds of war.
  but know, proud monarch, i'm thy slave no more
  my fleet shall waft me to thessalia's shore
  left by achilles on the trojan plain,
  what spoils, what conquests, shall atrides gain?
  to this the king   fly, mighty warrior! fly
  thy aid we need not, and thy threats defy.
  there want not chiefs in such a cause to fight,
  and jove himself shall guard a monarch's right.
  of all the kings  the god's distinguish'd care
  to power superior none such hatred bear
  strife and debate thy restless soul employ,
  and wars and horrors are thy savage joy,
  if thou hast strength, 'twas heaven that strength bestow'd
  for know, vain man! thy valour is from god.
  haste, launch thy vessels, fly with speed away
  rule thy own realms with arbitrary sway
  i heed thee not, but prize at equal rate
  thy short-lived friendship, and thy groundless hate.
  go, threat thy earth-born myrmidons --but here
  'tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.
  know, if the god the beauteous dame demand,
  my bark shall waft her to her native land
  but then prepare, imperious prince! prepare,
  fierce as thou art, to yield thy captive fair
  even in thy tent i'll seize the blooming prize,
  thy loved briseis with the radiant eyes.
  hence shalt thou prove my might, and curse the hour
  thou stood'st a rival of imperial power
  and hence, to all our hosts it shall be known,
  that kings are subject to the gods alone.
  achilles heard, with grief and rage oppress'd,
  his heart swell'd high, and labour'd in his breast
  distracting thoughts by turns his bosom ruled
  now fired by wrath, and now by reason cool'd
  that prompts his hand to draw the deadly sword,
  force through the greeks, and pierce their haughty lord
  this whispers soft his vengeance to control,
  and calm the rising tempest of his soul.
  just as in anguish of suspense he stay'd,
  while half unsheathed appear'd the glittering blade,
  minerva swift descended from above,
  sent by the sister and the wife of jove
   for both the princes claim'd her equal care
  behind she stood, and by the golden hair
  achilles seized  to him alone confess'd
  a sable cloud conceal'd her from the rest.
  he sees, and sudden to the goddess cries,
  known by the flames that sparkle from her eyes
   descends minerva, in her guardian care,
  a heavenly witness of the wrongs i bear
  from atreus' son?--then let those eyes that view
  the daring crime, behold the vengeance too.
   forbear  the progeny of jove replies
  to calm thy fury i forsake the skies
  let great achilles, to the gods resign'd,
  to reason yield the empire o'er his mind.
  by awful juno this command is given
  the king and you are both the care of heaven.
  the force of keen reproaches let him feel
  but sheathe, obedient, thy revenging steel.
  for i pronounce  and trust a heavenly power
  thy injured honour has its fated hour,
  when the proud monarch shall thy arms implores
  and bribe thy friendship with a boundless store.
  then let revenge no longer bear the sway
  command thy passions, and the gods obey.
  to her pelides -- with regardful ear,
  'tis just, o goddess! i thy dictates hear.
  hard as it is, my vengeance i suppress
  those who revere the gods the gods will bless.
  he said, observant of the blue-eyed maid
  then in the sheath return'd the shining blade.
  the goddess swift to high olympus flies,
  and joins the sacred senate of the skies.
  nor yet the rage his boiling breast forsook,
  which thus redoubling on atrides broke
   o monster! mix'd of insolence and fear,
  thou dog in forehead, but in heart a deer!
  when wert thou known in ambush'd fights to dare,
  or nobly face the horrid front of war?
  'tis ours, the chance of fighting fields to try
  thine to look on, and bid the valiant die
  so much 'tis safer through the camp to go,
  and rob a subject, than despoil a foe.
  scourge of thy people, violent and base!
  sent in jove's anger on a slavish race
  who, lost to sense of generous freedom past,
  are tamed to wrongs --or this had been thy last.
  now by this sacred sceptre hear me swear,
  which never more shall leaves or blossoms bear,
  which sever'd from the trunk  as i from thee
  on the bare mountains left its parent tree
  this sceptre, form'd by temper'd steel to prove
  an ensign of the delegates of jove,
  from whom the power of laws and justice springs
   tremendous oath! inviolate to kings
  by this i swear --when bleeding greece again
  shall call achilles, she shall call in vain.
  when, flush'd with slaughter, hector comes to spread
  the purpled shore with mountains of the dead,
  then shall thou mourn the affront thy madness gave,
  forced to deplore when impotent to save
  then rage in bitterness of soul to know
  this act has made the bravest greek thy foe.
  he spoke  and furious hurl'd against the ground
  his sceptre starr'd with golden studs around
  then sternly silent sat. with like disdain
  the raging king return'd his frowns again.
  to calm their passion with the words of age,
  slow from his seat arose the pylian sage,
  experienced nestor, in persuasion skill'd
  words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill'd
  two generations now had pass'd away,
  wise by his rules, and happy by his sway
  two ages o'er his native realm he reign'd,
  and now the example of the third remain'd.
  all view'd with awe the venerable man
  who thus with mild benevolence began --
   what shame, what woe is this to greece! what joy
  to troy's proud monarch, and the friends of troy!
  that adverse gods commit to stern debate
  the best, the bravest, of the grecian state.
  young as ye are, this youthful heat restrain,
  nor think your nestor's years and wisdom vain.
  a godlike race of heroes once i knew,
  such as no more these aged eyes shall view!
  lives there a chief to match pirithous' fame,
  dryas the bold, or ceneus' deathless name
  theseus, endued with more than mortal might,
  or polyphemus, like the gods in fight?
  with these of old, to toils of battle bred,
  in early youth my hardy days i led
  fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,
  and smit with love of honourable deeds,
  strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,
  ranged the wild deserts red with monsters' gore,
  and from their hills the shaggy centaurs tore
  yet these with soft persuasive arts i sway'd
  when nestor spoke, they listen'd and obey'd.
  if in my youth, even these esteem'd me wise
  do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.
  atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave
  that prize the greeks by common suffrage gave
  nor thou, achilles, treat our prince with pride
  let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.
  thee, the first honours of the war adorn,
  like gods in strength, and of a goddess born
  him, awful majesty exalts above
  the powers of earth, and sceptred sons of jove.
  let both unite with well-consenting mind,
  so shall authority with strength be join'd.
  leave me, o king! to calm achilles' rage
  rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.
  forbid it, gods! achilles should be lost,
  the pride of greece, and bulwark of our host.
  this said, he ceased. the king of men replies
   thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
  but that imperious, that unconquer'd soul,
  no laws can limit, no respect control.
  before his pride must his superiors fall
  his word the law, and he the lord of all?
  him must our hosts, our chiefs, ourself obey?
  what king can bear a rival in his sway?
  grant that the gods his matchless force have given
  has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?
  here on the monarch's speech achilles broke,
  and furious, thus, and interrupting spoke
   tyrant, i well deserved thy galling chain,
  to live thy slave, and still to serve in vain,
  should i submit to each unjust decree --
  command thy vassals, but command not me.
  seize on briseis, whom the grecians doom'd
  my prize of war, yet tamely see resumed
  and seize secure  no more achilles draws
  his conquering sword in any woman's cause.
  the gods command me to forgive the past
  but let this first invasion be the last
  for know, thy blood, when next thou darest invade,
  shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade.
  at this they ceased  the stern debate expired
  the chiefs in sullen majesty retired.
  achilles with patroclus took his way
  where near his tents his hollow vessels lay.
  meantime atrides launch'd with numerous oars
  a well-rigg'd ship for chrysa's sacred shores
  high on the deck was fair chryseis placed,
  and sage ulysses with the conduct graced
  safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow'd,
  then swiftly sailing, cut the liquid road.
  the host to expiate next the king prepares,
  with pure lustrations, and with solemn prayers.
  wash'd by the briny wave, the pious train
  are cleansed  and cast the ablutions in the main.
  along the shore whole hecatombs were laid,
  and bulls and goats to phoebus' altars paid
  the sable fumes in curling spires arise,
  and waft their grateful odours to the skies.
  the army thus in sacred rites engaged,
  atrides still with deep resentment raged.
  to wait his will two sacred heralds stood,
  talthybius and eurybates the good.
   haste to the fierce achilles' tent  he cries ,
  thence bear briseis as our royal prize
  submit he must  or if they will not part,
  ourself in arms shall tear her from his heart.
  the unwilling heralds act their lord's commands
  pensive they walk along the barren sands
  arrived, the hero in his tent they find,
  with gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.
  at awful distance long they silent stand,
  loth to advance, and speak their hard command
  decent confusion! this the godlike man
  perceived, and thus with accent mild began
   with leave and honour enter our abodes,
  ye sacred ministers of men and gods!
  i know your message  by constraint you came
  not you, but your imperious lord i blame.
  patroclus, haste, the fair briseis bring
  conduct my captive to the haughty king.
  but witness, heralds, and proclaim my vow,
  witness to gods above, and men below!
  but first, and loudest, to your prince declare
   that lawless tyrant whose commands you bear ,
  unmoved as death achilles shall remain,
  though prostrate greece shall bleed at every vein
  the raging chief in frantic passion lost,
  blind to himself, and useless to his host,
  unskill'd to judge the future by the past,
  in blood and slaughter shall repent at last.
  patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought
  she, in soft sorrows, and in pensive thought,
  pass'd silent, as the heralds held her hand,
  and of look'd back, slow-moving o'er the strand.
  not so his loss the fierce achilles bore
  but sad, retiring to the sounding shore,
  o'er the wild margin of the deep he hung,
  that kindred deep from whence his mother sprung
  there bathed in tears of anger and disdain,
  thus loud lamented to the stormy main
   o parent goddess! since in early bloom
  thy son must fall, by too severe a doom
  sure to so short a race of glory born,
  great jove in justice should this span adorn
  honour and fame at least the thunderer owed
  and ill he pays the promise of a god,
  if yon proud monarch thus thy son defies,
  obscures my glories, and resumes my prize.
  far from the deep recesses of the main,
  where aged ocean holds his watery reign,
  the goddess-mother heard. the waves divide
  and like a mist she rose above the tide
  beheld him mourning on the naked shores,
  and thus the sorrows of his soul explores.
   why grieves my son? thy anguish let me share
  reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care.
  he deeply sighing said   to tell my woe
  is but to mention what too well you know.
  from thebe, sacred to apollo's name
   aetion's realm , our conquering army came,
  with treasure loaded and triumphant spoils,
  whose just division crown'd the soldier's toils
  but bright chryseis, heavenly prize! was led,
  by vote selected, to the general's bed.
  the priest of phoebus sought by gifts to gain
  his beauteous daughter from the victor's chain
  the fleet he reach'd, and, lowly bending down,
  held forth the sceptre and the laurel crown,
  intreating all  but chief implored for grace
  the brother-kings of atreus' royal race
  the generous greeks their joint consent declare,
  the priest to reverence, and release the fair
  not so atrides  he, with wonted pride,
  the sire insulted, and his gifts denied
  the insulted sire  his god's peculiar care
  to phoebus pray'd, and phoebus heard the prayer
  a dreadful plague ensues  the avenging darts
  incessant fly, and pierce the grecian hearts.
  a prophet then, inspired by heaven, arose,
  and points the crime, and thence derives the woes
  myself the first the assembled chiefs incline
  to avert the vengeance of the power divine
  then rising in his wrath, the monarch storm'd
  incensed he threaten'd, and his threats perform'd
  the fair chryseis to her sire was sent,
  with offer'd gifts to make the god relent
  but now he seized briseis' heavenly charms,
  and of my valour's prize defrauds my arms,
  defrauds the votes of all the grecian train
  and service, faith, and justice, plead in vain.
  but, goddess! thou thy suppliant son attend.
  to high olympus' shining court ascend,
  urge all the ties to former service owed,
  and sue for vengeance to the thundering god.
  oft hast thou triumph'd in the glorious boast,
  that thou stood'st forth of all the ethereal host,
  when bold rebellion shook the realms above,
  the undaunted guard of cloud-compelling jove
  when the bright partner of his awful reign,
  the warlike maid, and monarch of the main,
  the traitor-gods, by mad ambition driven,
  durst threat with chains the omnipotence of heaven.
  then, call'd by thee, the monster titan came
   whom gods briareus, men  geon name ,
  through wondering skies enormous stalk'd along
  not he that shakes the solid earth so strong
  with giant-pride at jove's high throne he stands,
  and brandish'd round him all his hundred hands
  the affrighted gods confess'd their awful lord,
  they dropp'd the fetters, trembled, and adored.
  this, goddess, this to his remembrance call,
  embrace his knees, at his tribunal fall
  conjure him far to drive the grecian train,
  to hurl them headlong to their fleet and main,
  to heap the shores with copious death, and bring
  the greeks to know the curse of such a king.
  let agamemnon lift his haughty head
  o'er all his wide dominion of the dead,
  and mourn in blood that e'er he durst disgrace
  the boldest warrior of the grecian race.
   unhappy son!  fair thetis thus replies,
  while tears celestial trickle from her eyes
  why have i borne thee with a mother's throes,
  to fates averse, and nursed for future woes?
  so short a space the light of heaven to view!
  so short a space! and fill'd with sorrow too!
  o might a parent's careful wish prevail,
  far, far from ilion should thy vessels sail,
  and thou, from camps remote, the danger shun
  which now, alas! too nearly threats my son.
  yet  what i can  to move thy suit i'll go
  to great olympus crown'd with fleecy snow.
  meantime, secure within thy ships, from far
  behold the field, not mingle in the war.
  the sire of gods and all the ethereal train,
  on the warm limits of the farthest main,
  now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace
  the feasts of  thiopia's blameless race,
  twelve days the powers indulge the genial rite,
  returning with the twelfth revolving light.
  then will i mount the brazen dome, and move
  the high tribunal of immortal jove.
  the goddess spoke  the rolling waves unclose
  then down the steep she plunged from whence she rose,
  and left him sorrowing on the lonely coast,
  in wild resentment for the fair he lost.
  in chrysa's port now sage ulysses rode
  beneath the deck the destined victims stow'd
  the sails they furl'd, they lash the mast aside,
  and dropp'd their anchors, and the pinnace tied.
  next on the shore their hecatomb they land
  chryseis last descending on the strand.
  her, thus returning from the furrow'd main,
  ulysses led to phoebus' sacred fane
  where at his solemn altar, as the maid
  he gave to chryses, thus the hero said
   hail, reverend priest! to phoebus' awful dome
  a suppliant i from great atrides come
  unransom'd, here receive the spotless fair
  accept the hecatomb the greeks prepare
  and may thy god who scatters darts around,
  atoned by sacrifice, desist to wound.
  at this, the sire embraced the maid again,
  so sadly lost, so lately sought in vain.
  then near the altar of the darting king,
  disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring
  with water purify their hands, and take
  the sacred offering of the salted cake
  while thus with arms devoutly raised in air,
  and solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer
   god of the silver bow, thy ear incline,
  whose power incircles cilla the divine
  whose sacred eye thy tenedos surveys,
  and gilds fair chrysa with distinguish'd rays!
  if, fired to vengeance at thy priest's request,
  thy direful darts inflict the raging pest
  once more attend! avert the wasteful woe,
  and smile propitious, and unbend thy bow.
  so chryses pray'd. apollo heard his prayer
  and now the greeks their hecatomb prepare
  between their horns the salted barley threw,
  and, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew
  the limbs they sever from the inclosing hide
  the thighs, selected to the gods, divide
  on these, in double cauls involved with art,
  the choicest morsels lay from every part.
  the priest himself before his altar stands,
  and burns the offering with his holy hands.
  pours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire
  the youth with instruments surround the fire
  the thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd,
  the assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest
  then spread the tables, the repast prepare
  each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
  when now the rage of hunger was repress'd,
  with pure libations they conclude the feast
  the youths with wine the copious goblets crown'd,
  and, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around
  with hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,
  the paeans lengthen'd till the sun descends
  the greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong
  apollo listens, and approves the song.
  'twas night  the chiefs beside their vessel lie,
  till rosy morn had purpled o'er the sky
  then launch, and hoist the mast  indulgent gales,
  supplied by phoebus, fill the swelling sails
  the milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,
  the parted ocean foams and roars below
  above the bounding billows swift they flew,
  till now the grecian camp appear'd in view.
  far on the beach they haul their bark to land,
   the crooked keel divides the yellow sand,
  then part, where stretch'd along the winding bay,
  the ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.
  but raging still, amidst his navy sat
  the stern achilles, stedfast in his hate
  nor mix'd in combat, nor in council join'd
  but wasting cares lay heavy on his mind
  in his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll,
  and scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.
  twelve days were past, and now the dawning light
  the gods had summon'd to the olympian height
  jove, first ascending from the watery bowers,
  leads the long order of ethereal powers.
  when, like the morning-mist in early day,
  rose from the flood the daughter of the sea
  and to the seats divine her flight address'd.
  there, far apart, and high above the rest,
  the thunderer sat  where old olympus shrouds
  his hundred heads in heaven, and props the clouds.
  suppliant the goddess stood  one hand she placed
  beneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.
   if e'er, o father of the gods!  she said
  my words could please thee, or my actions aid,
  some marks of honour on my son bestow,
  and pay in glory what in life you owe.
  fame is at least by heavenly promise due
  to life so short, and now dishonour'd too.
  avenge this wrong, o ever just and wise!
  let greece be humbled, and the trojans rise
  till the proud king and all the achaian race
  shall heap with honours him they now disgrace.
  thus thetis spoke  but jove in silence held
  the sacred counsels of his breast conceal'd.
  not so repulsed, the goddess closer press'd,
  still grasp'd his knees, and urged the dear request.
   o sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear
  refuse, or grant  for what has jove to fear?
  or oh! declare, of all the powers above,
  is wretched thetis least the care of jove?
  she said  and, sighing, thus the god replies,
  who rolls the thunder o'er the vaulted skies
   what hast thou ask'd? ah, why should jove engage
  in foreign contests and domestic rage,
  the gods' complaints, and juno's fierce alarms,
  while i, too partial, aid the trojan arms?
  go, lest the haughty partner of my sway
  with jealous eyes thy close access survey
  but part in peace, secure thy prayer is sped
  witness the sacred honours of our head,
  the nod that ratifies the will divine,
  the faithful, fix'd, irrevocable sign
  this seals thy suit, and this fulfils thy vows--
  he spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,
  shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,
  the stamp of fate and sanction of the god
  high heaven with trembling the dread signal took,
  and all olympus to the centre shook.
  swift to the seas profound the goddess flies,
  jove to his starry mansions in the skies.
  the shining synod of the immortals wait
  the coming god, and from their thrones of state
  arising silent, wrapp'd in holy fear,
  before the majesty of heaven appear.
  trembling they stand, while jove assumes the throne,
  all, but the god's imperious queen alone
  late had she view'd the silver-footed dame,
  and all her passions kindled into flame.
   say, artful manager of heaven  she cries ,
  who now partakes the secrets of the skies?
  thy juno knows not the decrees of fate,
  in vain the partner of imperial state.
  what favourite goddess then those cares divides,
  which jove in prudence from his consort hides?
  to this the thunderer   seek not thou to find
  the sacred counsels of almighty mind
  involved in darkness likes the great decree,
  nor can the depths of fate be pierced by thee.
  what fits thy knowledge, thou the first shalt know
  the first of gods above, and men below
  but thou, nor they, shall search the thoughts that roll
  deep in the close recesses of my soul.
  full on the sire the goddess of the skies
  roll'd the large orbs of her majestic eyes,
  and thus return'd -- austere saturnius, say,
  from whence this wrath, or who controls thy sway?
  thy boundless will, for me, remains in force,
  and all thy counsels take the destined course.
  but 'tis for greece i fear  for late was seen,
  in close consult, the silver-footed queen.
  jove to his thetis nothing could deny,
  nor was the signal vain that shook the sky.
  what fatal favour has the goddess won,
  to grace her fierce, inexorable son?
  perhaps in grecian blood to drench the plain,
  and glut his vengeance with my people slain.
  then thus the god   o restless fate of pride,
  that strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide
  vain is the search, presumptuous and abhorr'd,
  anxious to thee, and odious to thy lord.
  let this suffice  the immutable decree
  no force can shake  what is, that ought to be.
  goddess, submit  nor dare our will withstand,
  but dread the power of this avenging hand
  the united strength of all the gods above
  in vain resists the omnipotence of jove.
                          illustration  vulcan.
                                 vulcan.
  the thunderer spoke, nor durst the queen reply
  a reverent horror silenced all the sky.
  the feast disturb'd, with sorrow vulcan saw
  his mother menaced, and the gods in awe
  peace at his heart, and pleasure his design,
  thus interposed the architect divine
   the wretched quarrels of the mortal state
  are far unworthy, gods! of your debate
  let men their days in senseless strife employ,
  we, in eternal peace and constant joy.
  thou, goddess-mother, with our sire comply,
  nor break the sacred union of the sky
  lest, roused to rage, he shake the bless'd abodes,
  launch the red lightning, and dethrone the gods.
  if you submit, the thunderer stands appeased
  the gracious power is willing to be pleased.
  thus vulcan spoke  and rising with a bound,
  the double bowl with sparkling nectar crown'd,
  which held to juno in a cheerful way,
   goddess  he cried , be patient and obey.
  dear as you are, if jove his arm extend,
  i can but grieve, unable to defend
  what god so daring in your aid to move,
  or lift his hand against the force of jove?
  once in your cause i felt his matchless might,
  hurl'd headlong down from the ethereal height
  toss'd all the day in rapid circles round,
  nor till the sun descended touch'd the ground.
  breathless i fell, in giddy motion lost
  the sinthians raised me on the lemnian coast
  he said, and to her hands the goblet heaved,
  which, with a smile, the white-arm'd queen received
  then, to the rest he fill'd  and in his turn,
  each to his lips applied the nectar'd urn,
  vulcan with awkward grace his office plies,
  and unextinguish'd laughter shakes the skies.
  thus the blest gods the genial day prolong,
  in feasts ambrosial, and celestial song.
  apollo tuned the lyre  the muses round
  with voice alternate aid the silver sound.
  meantime the radiant sun to mortal sight
  descending swift, roll'd down the rapid light
  then to their starry domes the gods depart,
  the shining monuments of vulcan's art
  jove on his couch reclined his awful head,
  and juno slumber'd on the golden bed.
  now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,
  stretch'd in the tents the grecian leaders lie
  the immortals slumber'd on their thrones above
  all, but the ever-wakeful eyes of jove.
  to honour thetis' son he bends his care,
  and plunge the greeks in all the woes of war
  then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,
  and thus commands the vision of the night.
   fly hence, deluding dream! and light as air,
  to agamemnon's ample tent repair.
  bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,
  lead all his grecians to the dusty plain.
  declare, e'en now 'tis given him to destroy
  the lofty towers of wide-extended troy.
  for now no more the gods with fate contend,
  at juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
  destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
  and nodding ilion waits the impending fall.
  swift as the word the vain illusion fled,
  descends, and hovers o'er atrides' head
  clothed in the figure of the pylian sage,
  renown'd for wisdom, and revered for age
  around his temples spreads his golden wing,
  and thus the flattering dream deceives the king.
   canst thou, with all a monarch's cares oppress'd,
  o atreus' son! canst thou indulge the rest?
  ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,
  directs in council, and in war presides,
  to whom its safety a whole people owes,
  to waste long nights in indolent repose.
  monarch, awake! 'tis jove's command i bear
  thou, and thy glory, claim his heavenly care.
  in just array draw forth the embattled train,
  lead all thy grecians to the dusty plain
  e'en now, o king! 'tis given thee to destroy
  the lofty towers of wide-extended troy.
  for now no more the gods with fate contend,
  at juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
  destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
  and nodding ilion waits the impending fall.
  awake, but waking this advice approve,
  and trust the vision that descends from jove.
  the phantom said  then vanish'd from his sight,
  resolves to air, and mixes with the night.
  a thousand schemes the monarch's mind employ
  elate in thought he sacks untaken troy
  vain as he was, and to the future blind,
  nor saw what jove and secret fate design'd,
  what mighty toils to either host remain,
  what scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain!
  eager he rises, and in fancy hears
  the voice celestial murmuring in his ears.
  first on his limbs a slender vest he drew,
  around him next the regal mantle threw,
  the embroider'd sandals on his feet were tied
  the starry falchion glitter'd at his side
  and last, his arm the massy sceptre loads,
  unstain'd, immortal, and the gift of gods.
  now rosy morn ascends the court of jove,
  lifts up her light, and opens day above.
  the king despatch'd his heralds with commands
  to range the camp and summon all the bands
  the gathering hosts the monarch's word obey
  while to the fleet atrides bends his way.
  in his black ship the pylian prince he found
  there calls a senate of the peers around
  the assembly placed, the king of men express'd
  the counsels labouring in his artful breast.
   friends and confederates! with attentive ear
  receive my words, and credit what you hear.
  late as i slumber'd in the shades of night,
  a dream divine appear'd before my sight
  whose visionary form like nestor came,
  the same in habit, and in mien the same.
  the heavenly phantom hover'd o'er my head,
  'and, dost thou sleep, o atreus' son?  he said
  ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,
  directs in council, and in war presides
  to whom its safety a whole people owes,
  to waste long nights in indolent repose.
  monarch, awake! 'tis jove's command i bear,
  thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.
  in just array draw forth the embattled train,
  and lead the grecians to the dusty plain
  e'en now, o king! 'tis given thee to destroy
  the lofty towers of wide-extended troy.
  for now no more the gods with fate contend,
  at juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
  destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
  and nodding ilion waits the impending fall.
  this hear observant, and the gods obey!'
  the vision spoke, and pass'd in air away.
  now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,
  unite, and rouse the sons of greece to arms.
  but first, with caution, try what yet they dare,
  worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.
  to move the troops to measure back the main,
  be mine  and yours the province to detain.
  he spoke, and sat  when nestor, rising said,
   nestor, whom pylos' sandy realms obey'd,
   princes of greece, your faithful ears incline,
  nor doubt the vision of the powers divine
  sent by great jove to him who rules the host,
  forbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost!
  then let us haste, obey the god's alarms,
  and join to rouse the sons of greece to arms.
  thus spoke the sage  the kings without delay
  dissolve the council, and their chief obey
  the sceptred rulers lead  the following host,
  pour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.
  as from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees
  clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,
  rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,
  with deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms
  dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,
  and o'er the vale descends the living cloud.
  so, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train
  spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain
  along the region runs a deafening sound
  beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.
  fame flies before the messenger of jove,
  and shining soars, and claps her wings above.
  nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud
  the monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd.
  soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,
  and fainter murmurs died upon the ear,
  the king of kings his awful figure raised
  high in his hand the golden sceptre blazed
  the golden sceptre, of celestial flame,
  by vulcan form'd, from jove to hermes came.
  to pelops he the immortal gift resign'd
  the immortal gift great pelops left behind,
  in atreus' hand, which not with atreus ends,
  to rich thyestes next the prize descends
  and now the mark of agamemnon's reign,
  subjects all argos, and controls the main.
  on this bright sceptre now the king reclined,
  and artful thus pronounced the speech design'd
   ye sons of mars, partake your leader's care,
  heroes of greece, and brothers of the war!
  of partial jove with justice i complain,
  and heavenly oracles believed in vain
  a safe return was promised to our toils,
  renown'd, triumphant, and enrich'd with spoils.
  now shameful flight alone can save the host,
  our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.
  so jove decrees, resistless lord of all!
  at whose command whole empires rise or fall
  he shakes the feeble props of human trust,
  and towns and armies humbles to the dust
  what shame to greece a fruitful war to wage,
  oh, lasting shame in every future age!
  once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,
  repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.
  so small their number, that if wars were ceased,
  and greece triumphant held a general feast,
  all rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine
  must want a trojan slave to pour the wine.
  but other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,
  and troy prevails by armies not her own.
  now nine long years of mighty jove are run,
  since first the labours of this war begun
  our cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,
  and scarce insure the wretched power to fly.
  haste, then, for ever leave the trojan wall!
  our weeping wives, our tender children call
  love, duty, safety, summon us away,
  'tis nature's voice, and nature we obey,
  our shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er,
  safe and inglorious, to our native shore.
  fly, grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,
  and dream no more of heaven-defended troy.
  his deep design unknown, the hosts approve
  atrides' speech. the mighty numbers move.
  so roll the billows to the icarian shore,
  from east and south when winds begin to roar,
  burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep
  the whitening surface of the ruffled deep.
  and as on corn when western gusts descend,
  before the blast the lofty harvests bend
  thus o'er the field the moving host appears,
  with nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.
  the gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet
  beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet
  with long-resounding cries they urge the train
  to fit the ships, and launch into the main.
  they toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise,
  the doubling clamours echo to the skies.
  e'en then the greeks had left the hostile plain,
  and fate decreed the fall of troy in vain
  but jove's imperial queen their flight survey'd,
  and sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid
   shall then the grecians fly! o dire disgrace!
  and leave unpunish'd this perfidious race?
  shall troy, shall priam, and the adulterous spouse,
  in peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?
  and bravest chiefs, in helen's quarrel slain,
  lie unrevenged on yon detested plain?
  no  let my greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,
  once more refulgent shine in brazen arms.
  haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,
  nor let one sail be hoisted on the main.
  pallas obeys, and from olympus' height
  swift to the ships precipitates her flight.
  ulysses, first in public cares, she found,
  for prudent counsel like the gods renown'd
  oppress'd with generous grief the hero stood,
  nor drew his sable vessels to the flood.
   and is it thus, divine laertes' son,
  thus fly the greeks  the martial maid begun ,
  thus to their country bear their own disgrace,
  and fame eternal leave to priam's race?
  shall beauteous helen still remain unfreed,
  still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!
  haste, generous ithacus! prevent the shame,
  recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.
  your own resistless eloquence employ,
  and to the immortals trust the fall of troy.
  the voice divine confess'd the warlike maid,
  ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey'd
  then meeting first atrides, from his hand
  received the imperial sceptre of command.
  thus graced, attention and respect to gain,
  he runs, he flies through all the grecian train
  each prince of name, or chief in arms approved,
  he fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.
   warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless'd,
  by brave examples should confirm the rest.
  the monarch's will not yet reveal'd appears
  he tries our courage, but resents our fears.
  the unwary greeks his fury may provoke
  not thus the king in secret council spoke.
  jove loves our chief, from jove his honour springs,
  beware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings.
  but if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,
  him with reproof he check'd or tamed with blows.
   be still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield
  unknown alike in council and in field!
  ye gods, what dastards would our host command!
  swept to the war, the lumber of a land.
  be silent, wretch, and think not here allow'd
  that worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.
  to one sole monarch jove commits the sway
  his are the laws, and him let all obey.
  with words like these the troops ulysses ruled,
  the loudest silenced, and the fiercest cool'd.
  back to the assembly roll the thronging train,
  desert the ships, and pour upon the plain.
  murmuring they move, as when old ocean roars,
  and heaves huge surges to the trembling shores
  the groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound,
  the rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound.
  at length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,
  and a still silence lulls the camp to peace.
  thersites only clamour'd in the throng,
  loquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue
  awed by no shame, by no respect controll'd,
  in scandal busy, in reproaches bold
  with witty malice studious to defame,
  scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim --
  but chief he gloried with licentious style
  to lash the great, and monarchs to revile.
  his figure such as might his soul proclaim
  one eye was blinking, and one leg was lame
  his mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,
  thin hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen head.
  spleen to mankind his envious heart possess'd,
  and much he hated all, but most the best
  ulysses or achilles still his theme
  but royal scandal his delight supreme,
  long had he lived the scorn of every greek,
  vex'd when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.
  sharp was his voice  which in the shrillest tone,
  thus with injurious taunts attack'd the throne.
   amidst the glories of so bright a reign,
  what moves the great atrides to complain?
  'tis thine whate'er the warrior's breast inflames,
  the golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames.
  with all the wealth our wars and blood bestow,
  thy tents are crowded and thy chests o'erflow.
  thus at full ease in heaps of riches roll'd,
  what grieves the monarch? is it thirst of gold?
  say, shall we march with our unconquer'd powers
   the greeks and i  to ilion's hostile towers,
  and bring the race of royal bastards here,
  for troy to ransom at a price too dear?
  but safer plunder thy own host supplies
  say, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader's prize?
  or, if thy heart to generous love be led,
  some captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?
  whate'er our master craves submit we must,
  plagued with his pride, or punish'd for his lust.
  oh women of achaia  men no more!
  hence let us fly, and let him waste his store
  in loves and pleasures on the phrygian shore.
  we may be wanted on some busy day,
  when hector comes  so great achilles may
  from him he forced the prize we jointly gave,
  from him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave
  and durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,
  this mighty tyrant were no tyrant long.
  fierce from his seat at this ulysses springs,
  in generous vengeance of the king of kings.
  with indignation sparkling in his eyes,
  he views the wretch, and sternly thus replies
   peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,
  with wrangling talents form'd for foul debate
  curb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,
  and singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.
  have we not known thee, slave! of all our host,
  the man who acts the least, upbraids the most?
  think not the greeks to shameful flight to bring,
  nor let those lips profane the name of king.
  for our return we trust the heavenly powers
  be that their care  to fight like men be ours.
  but grant the host with wealth the general load,
  except detraction, what hast thou bestow'd?
  suppose some hero should his spoils resign,
  art thou that hero, could those spoils be thine?
  gods! let me perish on this hateful shore,
  and let these eyes behold my son no more
  if, on thy next offence, this hand forbear
  to strip those arms thou ill deserv'st to wear,
  expel the council where our princes meet,
  and send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.
  he said, and cowering as the dastard bends,
  the weighty sceptre on his bank descends.
  on the round bunch the bloody tumours rise
  the tears spring starting from his haggard eyes
  trembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,
  from his vile visage wiped the scalding tears
  while to his neighbour each express'd his thought
   ye gods! what wonders has ulysses wrought!
  what fruits his conduct and his courage yield!
  great in the council, glorious in the field.
  generous he rises in the crown's defence,
  to curb the factious tongue of insolence,
  such just examples on offenders shown,
  sedition silence, and assert the throne.
  'twas thus the general voice the hero praised,
  who, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised
  the blue-eyed pallas, his celestial friend,
   in form a herald,  bade the crowds attend.
  the expecting crowds in still attention hung,
  to hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.
  then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,
  his silence thus the prudent hero broke
   unhappy monarch! whom the grecian race
  with shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.
  not such at argos was their generous vow
  once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now
  ne'er to return, was then the common cry,
  till troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.
  behold them weeping for their native shore
  what could their wives or helpless children more?
  what heart but melts to leave the tender train,
  and, one short month, endure the wintry main?
  few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,
  when the ship tosses, and the tempests beat
  then well may this long stay provoke their tears,
  the tedious length of nine revolving years.
  not for their grief the grecian host i blame
  but vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!
  expect the time to troy's destruction given.
  and try the faith of chalcas and of heaven.
  what pass'd at aulis, greece can witness bear,
  and all who live to breathe this phrygian air.
  beside a fountain's sacred brink we raised
  our verdant altars, and the victims blazed
  'twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,
  the altars heaved  and from the crumbling ground
  a mighty dragon shot, of dire portent
  from jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.
  straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,
  and curl'd around in many a winding fold
  the topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd
  eight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest
  herself the ninth  the serpent, as he hung,
  stretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young
  while hovering near, with miserable moan,
  the drooping mother wail'd her children gone.
  the mother last, as round the nest she flew,
  seized by the beating wing, the monster slew
  nor long survived  to marble turn'd, he stands
  a lasting prodigy on aulis' sands.
  such was the will of jove  and hence we dare
  trust in his omen, and support the war.
  for while around we gazed with wondering eyes,
  and trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,
  full of his god, the reverend chalcas cried,
  'ye grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.
  this wondrous signal jove himself displays,
  of long, long labours, but eternal praise.
  as many birds as by the snake were slain,
  so many years the toils of greece remain
  but wait the tenth, for ilion's fall decreed '
  thus spoke the prophet, thus the fates succeed.
  obey, ye grecians! with submission wait,
  nor let your flight avert the trojan fate.
  he said  the shores with loud applauses sound,
  the hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.
  then nestor thus-- these vain debates forbear,
  ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.
  where now are all your high resolves at last?
  your leagues concluded, your engagements past?
  vow'd with libations and with victims then,
  now vanish'd like their smoke  the faith of men!
  while useless words consume the unactive hours,
  no wonder troy so long resists our powers.
  rise, great atrides! and with courage sway
  we march to war, if thou direct the way.
  but leave the few that dare resist thy laws,
  the mean deserters of the grecian cause,
  to grudge the conquests mighty jove prepares,
  and view with envy our successful wars.
  on that great day, when first the martial train,
  big with the fate of ilion, plough'd the main,
  jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,
  and thunder rolling shook the firmament.
  encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,
  till every soldier grasp a phrygian wife,
  till helen's woes at full revenged appear,
  and troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.
  before that day, if any greek invite
  his country's troops to base, inglorious flight,
  stand forth that greek! and hoist his sail to fly,
  and die the dastard first, who dreads to die.
  but now, o monarch! all thy chiefs advise
  nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.
  among those counsels, let not mine be vain
  in tribes and nations to divide thy train
  his separate troops let every leader call,
  each strengthen each, and all encourage all.
  what chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,
  or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,
  when thus distinct they war, shall soon be known
  and what the cause of ilion not o'erthrown
  if fate resists, or if our arms are slow,
  if gods above prevent, or men below.
  to him the king   how much thy years excel
  in arts of counsel, and in speaking well!
  o would the gods, in love to greece, decree
  but ten such sages as they grant in thee
  such wisdom soon should priam's force destroy,
  and soon should fall the haughty towers of troy!
  but jove forbids, who plunges those he hates
  in fierce contention and in vain debates
  now great achilles from our aid withdraws,
  by me provoked  a captive maid the cause
  if e'er as friends we join, the trojan wall
  must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!
  but now, ye warriors, take a short repast
  and, well refresh'd, to bloody conflict haste.
  his sharpen'd spear let every grecian wield,
  and every grecian fix his brazen shield,
  let all excite the fiery steeds of war,
  and all for combat fit the rattling car.
  this day, this dreadful day, let each contend
  no rest, no respite, till the shades descend
  till darkness, or till death, shall cover all
  let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall
  till bathed in sweat be every manly breast,
  with the huge shield each brawny arm depress'd,
  each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,
  and each spent courser at the chariot blow.
  who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,
  who dares to tremble on this signal day
  that wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,
  the birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour.
  the monarch spoke  and straight a murmur rose,
  loud as the surges when the tempest blows,
  that dash'd on broken rocks tumultuous roar,
  and foam and thunder on the stony shore.
  straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,
  the fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend
  with hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,
  to avert the dangers of the doubtful day.
  a steer of five years' age, large limb'd, and fed,
  to jove's high altars agamemnon led
  there bade the noblest of the grecian peers
  and nestor first, as most advanced in years.
  next came idomeneus,
  and tydeus' son,
  ajax the less, and ajax telamon
  then wise ulysses in his rank was placed
  and menelaus came, unbid, the last.
  the chiefs surround the destined beast, and take
  the sacred offering of the salted cake
  when thus the king prefers his solemn prayer
   o thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air,
  who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,
  supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone!
  hear! and before the burning sun descends,
  before the night her gloomy veil extends,
  low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires,
  be priam's palace sunk in grecian fires.
  in hector's breast be plunged this shining sword,
  and slaughter'd heroes groan around their lord!
  thus prayed the chief  his unavailing prayer
  great jove refused, and toss'd in empty air
  the god averse, while yet the fumes arose,
  prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.
  their prayers perform'd the chiefs the rite pursue,
  the barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.
  the limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,
  the thighs, selected to the gods, divide.
  on these, in double cauls involved with art,
  the choicest morsels lie from every part,
  from the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire
  while the fat victims feed the sacred fire.
  the thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd
  the assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest
  then spread the tables, the repast prepare,
  each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
  soon as the rage of hunger was suppress'd,
  the generous nestor thus the prince address'd.
   now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,
  and call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms
  now seize the occasion, now the troops survey,
  and lead to war when heaven directs the way.
  he said  the monarch issued his commands
  straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands
  the chiefs inclose their king  the hosts divide,
  in tribes and nations rank'd on either side.
  high in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies
  from rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes
  the dreadful aegis, jove's immortal shield,
  blazed on her arm, and lighten'd all the field
  round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll'd,
  form'd the bright fringe, and seem'd to burn in gold,
  with this each grecian's manly breast she warms,
  swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,
  no more they sigh, inglorious, to return,
  but breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.
  as on some mountain, through the lofty grove,
  the crackling flames ascend, and blaze above
  the fires expanding, as the winds arise,
  shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies
  so from the polish'd arms, and brazen shields,
  a gleamy splendour flash'd along the fields.
  not less their number than the embodied cranes,
  or milk-white swans in asius' watery plains.
  that, o'er the windings of cayster's springs,
  stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,
  now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,
  now light with noise  with noise the field resounds.
  thus numerous and confused, extending wide,
  the legions crowd scamander's flowery side
  with rushing troops the plains are cover'd o'er,
  and thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.
  along the river's level meads they stand,
  thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,
  or leaves the trees  or thick as insects play,
  the wandering nation of a summer's day
  that, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,
  in gather'd swarms surround the rural bowers
  from pail to pail with busy murmur run
  the gilded legions, glittering in the sun.
  so throng'd, so close, the grecian squadrons stood
  in radiant arms, and thirst for trojan blood.
  each leader now his scatter'd force conjoins
  in close array, and forms the deepening lines.
  not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain
  collects his flocks from thousands on the plain.
  the king of kings, majestically tall,
  towers o'er his armies, and outshines them all
  like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads
  his subject herds, the monarch of the meads,
  great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,
  his strength like neptune, and like mars his mien
  jove o'er his eyes celestial glories spread,
  and dawning conquest played around his head.
  say, virgins, seated round the throne divine,
  all-knowing goddesses! immortal nine!
  since earth's wide regions, heaven's umneasur'd height,
  and hell's abyss, hide nothing from your sight,
   we, wretched mortals! lost in doubts below,
  but guess by rumour, and but boast we know,
  o say what heroes, fired by thirst of fame,
  or urged by wrongs, to troy's destruction came.
  to count them all, demands a thousand tongues,
  a throat of brass, and adamantine lungs.
  daughters of jove, assist! inspired by you
  the mighty labour dauntless i pursue
  what crowded armies, from what climes they bring,
  their names, their numbers, and their chiefs i sing.
  the hardy warriors whom boeotia bred,
  penelius, leitus, prothoenor, led
  with these arcesilaus and clonius stand,
  equal in arms, and equal in command.
  these head the troops that rocky aulis yields,
  and eteon's hills, and hyrie's watery fields,
  and schoenos, scholos, graea near the main,
  and mycalessia's ample piny plain
  those who in peteon or ilesion dwell,
  or harma where apollo's prophet fell
  heleon and hyle, which the springs o'erflow
  and medeon lofty, and ocalea low
  or in the meads of haliartus stray,
  or thespia sacred to the god of day
  onchestus, neptune's celebrated groves
  copae, and thisbe, famed for silver doves
  for flocks erythrae, glissa for the vine
  platea green, and nysa the divine
  and they whom thebe's well-built walls inclose,
  where myde, eutresis, corone, rose
  and arne rich, with purple harvests crown'd
  and anthedon, boeotia's utmost bound.
  full fifty ships they send, and each conveys
  twice sixty warriors through the foaming seas.
  to these succeed aspledon's martial train,
  who plough the spacious orchomenian plain.
  two valiant brothers rule the undaunted throng,
  ialmen and ascalaphus the strong
  sons of astyoche, the heavenly fair,
  whose virgin charms subdued the god of war
   in actor's court as she retired to rest,
  the strength of mars the blushing maid compress'd
  their troops in thirty sable vessels sweep,
  with equal oars, the hoarse-resounding deep.
  the phocians next in forty barks repair
  epistrophus and schedius head the war
  from those rich regions where cephisus leads
  his silver current through the flowery meads
  from panopea, chrysa the divine,
  where anemoria's stately turrets shine,
  where pytho, daulis, cyparissus stood,
  and fair lilaea views the rising flood.
  these, ranged in order on the floating tide,
  close, on the left, the bold boeotians' side.
  fierce ajax led the locrian squadrons on,
  ajax the less, oileus' valiant son
  skill'd to direct the flying dart aright
  swift in pursuit, and active in the fight.
  him, as their chief, the chosen troops attend,
  which bessa, thronus, and rich cynos send
  opus, calliarus, and scarphe's bands
  and those who dwell where pleasing augia stands,
  and where boagrius floats the lowly lands,
  or in fair tarphe's sylvan seats reside
  in forty vessels cut the yielding tide.
  euboea next her martial sons prepares,
  and sends the brave abantes to the wars
  breathing revenge, in arms they take their way
  from chalcis' walls, and strong eretria
  the isteian fields for generous vines renown'd,
  the fair caristos, and the styrian ground
  where dios from her towers o'erlooks the plain,
  and high cerinthus views the neighbouring main.
  down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair
  their hands dismiss not the long lance in air
  but with protended spears in fighting fields
  pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields.
  twice twenty ships transport the warlike bands,
  which bold elphenor, fierce in arms, commands.
  full fifty more from athens stem the main,
  led by menestheus through the liquid plain.
   athens the fair, where great erectheus sway'd,
  that owed his nurture to the blue-eyed maid,
  but from the teeming furrow took his birth,
  the mighty offspring of the foodful earth.
  him pallas placed amidst her wealthy fane,
  adored with sacrifice and oxen slain
  where, as the years revolve, her altars blaze,
  and all the tribes resound the goddess' praise.
  no chief like thee, menestheus! greece could yield,
  to marshal armies in the dusty field,
  the extended wings of battle to display,
  or close the embodied host in firm array.
  nestor alone, improved by length of days,
  for martial conduct bore an equal praise.
  with these appear the salaminian bands,
  whom the gigantic telamon commands
  in twelve black ships to troy they steer their course,
  and with the great athenians join their force.
  next move to war the generous argive train,
  from high troezene, and maseta's plain,
  and fair  gina circled by the main
  whom strong tyrinthe's lofty walls surround,
  and epidaure with viny harvests crown'd
  and where fair asinen and hermoin show
  their cliffs above, and ample bay below.
  these by the brave euryalus were led,
  great sthenelus, and greater diomed
  but chief tydides bore the sovereign sway
  in fourscore barks they plough the watery way.
  the proud mycene arms her martial powers,
  cleone, corinth, with imperial towers,
  fair araethyrea, ornia's fruitful plain,
  and  gion, and adrastus' ancient reign
  and those who dwell along the sandy shore,
  and where pellene yields her fleecy store,
  where helice and hyperesia lie,
  and gonoessa's spires salute the sky.
  great agamemnon rules the numerous band,
  a hundred vessels in long order stand,
  and crowded nations wait his dread command.
  high on the deck the king of men appears,
  and his refulgent arms in triumph wears
  proud of his host, unrivall'd in his reign,
  in silent pomp he moves along the main.
  his brother follows, and to vengeance warms
  the hardy spartans, exercised in arms
  phares and brysia's valiant troops, and those
  whom lacedaemon's lofty hills inclose
  or messe's towers for silver doves renown'd,
  amyclae, laas, augia's happy ground,
  and those whom oetylos' low walls contain,
  and helos, on the margin of the main
  these, o'er the bending ocean, helen's cause,
  in sixty ships with menelaus draws
  eager and loud from man to man he flies,
  revenge and fury flaming in his eyes
  while vainly fond, in fancy oft he hears
  the fair one's grief, and sees her falling tears.
  in ninety sail, from pylos' sandy coast,
  nestor the sage conducts his chosen host
  from amphigenia's ever-fruitful land,
  where  py high, and little pteleon stand
  where beauteous arene her structures shows,
  and thryon's walls alpheus' streams inclose
  and dorion, famed for thamyris' disgrace,
  superior once of all the tuneful race,
  till, vain of mortals' empty praise, he strove
  to match the seed of cloud-compelling jove!
  too daring bard! whose unsuccessful pride
  the immortal muses in their art defied.
  the avenging muses of the light of day
  deprived his eyes, and snatch'd his voice away
  no more his heavenly voice was heard to sing,
  his hand no more awaked the silver string.
  where under high cyllene, crown'd with wood,
  the shaded tomb of old  pytus stood
  from ripe, stratie, tegea's bordering towns,
  the phenean fields, and orchomenian downs,
  where the fat herds in plenteous pasture rove
  and stymphelus with her surrounding grove
  parrhasia, on her snowy cliffs reclined,
  and high enispe shook by wintry wind,
  and fair mantinea's ever-pleasing site
  in sixty sail the arcadian bands unite.
  bold agapenor, glorious at their head,
   ancaeus' son  the mighty squadron led.
  their ships, supplied by agamemnon's care,
  through roaring seas the wondering warriors bear
  the first to battle on the appointed plain,
  but new to all the dangers of the main.
  those, where fair elis and buprasium join
  whom hyrmin, here, and myrsinus confine,
  and bounded there, where o'er the valleys rose
  the olenian rock  and where alisium flows
  beneath four chiefs  a numerous army  came
  the strength and glory of the epean name.
  in separate squadrons these their train divide,
  each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide.
  one was amphimachus, and thalpius one
   eurytus' this, and that teatus' son
  diores sprung from amarynceus' line
  and great polyxenus, of force divine.
  but those who view fair elis o'er the seas
  from the blest islands of the echinades,
  in forty vessels under meges move,
  begot by phyleus, the beloved of jove
  to strong dulichium from his sire he fled,
  and thence to troy his hardy warriors led.
  ulysses follow'd through the watery road,
  a chief, in wisdom equal to a god.
  with those whom cephalenia's line inclosed,
  or till their fields along the coast opposed
  or where fair ithaca o'erlooks the floods,
  where high neritos shakes his waving woods,
  where  gilipa's rugged sides are seen,
  crocylia rocky, and zacynthus green.
  these in twelve galleys with vermilion prores,
  beneath his conduct sought the phrygian shores.
  thoas came next, andraemon's valiant son,
  from pleuron's walls, and chalky calydon,
  and rough pylene, and the olenian steep,
  and chalcis, beaten by the rolling deep.
  he led the warriors from the  tolian shore,
  for now the sons of oeneus were no more!
  the glories of the mighty race were fled!
  oeneus himself, and meleager dead!
  to thoas' care now trust the martial train,
  his forty vessels follow through the main.
  next, eighty barks the cretan king commands,
  of gnossus, lyctus, and gortyna's bands
  and those who dwell where rhytion's domes arise,
  or white lycastus glitters to the skies,
  or where by phaestus silver jardan runs
  crete's hundred cities pour forth all her sons.
  these march'd, idomeneus, beneath thy care,
  and merion, dreadful as the god of war.
  tlepolemus, the sun of hercules,
  led nine swift vessels through the foamy seas,
  from rhodes, with everlasting sunshine bright,
  jalyssus, lindus, and camirus white.
  his captive mother fierce alcides bore
  from ephyr's walls and selle's winding shore,
  where mighty towns in ruins spread the plain,
  and saw their blooming warriors early slain.
  the hero, when to manly years he grew,
  alcides' uncle, old licymnius, slew
  for this, constrain'd to quit his native place,
  and shun the vengeance of the herculean race,
  a fleet he built, and with a numerous train
  of willing exiles wander'd o'er the main
  where, many seas and many sufferings past,
  on happy rhodes the chief arrived at last
  there in three tribes divides his native band,
  and rules them peaceful in a foreign land
  increased and prosper'd in their new abodes
  by mighty jove, the sire of men and gods
  with joy they saw the growing empire rise,
  and showers of wealth descending from the skies.
  three ships with nireus sought the trojan shore,
  nireus, whom aglae to charopus bore,
  nireus, in faultless shape and blooming grace,
  the loveliest youth of all the grecian race
  pelides only match'd his early charms
  but few his troops, and small his strength in arms.
  next thirty galleys cleave the liquid plain,
  of those calydnae's sea-girt isles contain
  with them the youth of nisyrus repair,
  casus the strong, and crapathus the fair
  cos, where eurypylus possess'd the sway,
  till great alcides made the realms obey
  these antiphus and bold phidippus bring,
  sprung from the god by thessalus the king.
  now, muse, recount pelasgic argos' powers,
  from alos, alope, and trechin's towers
  from phthia's spacious vales  and hella, bless'd
  with female beauty far beyond the rest.
  full fifty ships beneath achilles' care,
  the achaians, myrmidons, hellenians bear
  thessalians all, though various in their name
  the same their nation, and their chief the same.
  but now inglorious, stretch'd along the shore,
  they hear the brazen voice of war no more
  no more the foe they face in dire array
  close in his fleet the angry leader lay
  since fair briseis from his arms was torn,
  the noblest spoil from sack'd lyrnessus borne,
  then, when the chief the theban walls o'erthrew,
  and the bold sons of great evenus slew.
  there mourn'd achilles, plunged in depth of care,
  but soon to rise in slaughter, blood, and war.
  to these the youth of phylace succeed,
  itona, famous for her fleecy breed,
  and grassy pteleon deck'd with cheerful greens,
  the bowers of ceres, and the sylvan scenes.
  sweet pyrrhasus, with blooming flowerets crown'd,
  and antron's watery dens, and cavern'd ground.
  these own'd, as chief, protesilas the brave,
  who now lay silent in the gloomy grave
  the first who boldly touch'd the trojan shore,
  and dyed a phrygian lance with grecian gore
  there lies, far distant from his native plain
  unfinish'd his proud palaces remain,
  and his sad consort beats her breast in vain.
  his troops in forty ships podarces led,
  iphiclus' son, and brother to the dead
  nor he unworthy to command the host
  yet still they mourn'd their ancient leader lost.
  the men who glaphyra's fair soil partake,
  where hills incircle boebe's lowly lake,
  where phaere hears the neighbouring waters fall,
  or proud iolcus lifts her airy wall,
  in ten black ships embark'd for ilion's shore,
  with bold eumelus, whom alceste bore
  all pelias' race alceste far outshined,
  the grace and glory of the beauteous kind,
  the troops methone or thaumacia yields,
  olizon's rocks, or meliboea's fields,
  with philoctetes sail'd whose matchless art
  from the tough bow directs the feather'd dart.
  seven were his ships  each vessel fifty row,
  skill'd in his science of the dart and bow.
  but he lay raging on the lemnian ground,
  a poisonous hydra gave the burning wound
  there groan'd the chief in agonizing pain,
  whom greece at length shall wish, nor wish in vain.
  his forces medon led from lemnos' shore,
  oileus' son, whom beauteous rhena bore.
  the oechalian race, in those high towers contain'd
  where once eurytus in proud triumph reign'd,
  or where her humbler turrets tricca rears,
  or where ithome, rough with rocks, appears,
  in thirty sail the sparkling waves divide,
  which podalirius and machaon guide.
  to these his skill their parent-god imparts,
  divine professors of the healing arts.
  the bold ormenian and asterian bands
  in forty barks eurypylus commands.
  where titan hides his hoary head in snow,
  and where hyperia's silver fountains flow.
  thy troops, argissa, polypoetes leads,
  and eleon, shelter'd by olympus' shades,
  gyrtone's warriors  and where orthe lies,
  and oloosson's chalky cliffs arise.
  sprung from pirithous of immortal race,
  the fruit of fair hippodame's embrace,
   that day, when hurl'd from pelion's cloudy head,
  to distant dens the shaggy centaurs fled
  with polypoetes join'd in equal sway
  leonteus leads, and forty ships obey.
  in twenty sail the bold perrhaebians came
  from cyphus, guneus was their leader's name.
  with these the enians join'd, and those who freeze
  where cold dodona lifts her holy trees
  or where the pleasing titaresius glides,
  and into peneus rolls his easy tides
  yet o'er the silvery surface pure they flow,
  the sacred stream unmix'd with streams below,
  sacred and awful! from the dark abodes
  styx pours them forth, the dreadful oath of gods!
  last, under prothous the magnesians stood,
   prothous the swift, of old tenthredon's blood
  who dwell where pelion, crown'd with piny boughs,
  obscures the glade, and nods his shaggy brows
  or where through flowery tempe peneus stray'd
   the region stretch'd beneath his mighty shade
  in forty sable barks they stemm'd the main
  such were the chiefs, and such the grecian train.
  say next, o muse! of all achaia breeds,
  who bravest fought, or rein'd the noblest steeds?
  eumelus' mares were foremost in the chase,
  as eagles fleet, and of pheretian race
  bred where pieria's fruitful fountains flow,
  and train'd by him who bears the silver bow.
  fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flame,
  their height, their colour, and their age the same
  o'er fields of death they whirl the rapid car,
  and break the ranks, and thunder through the war.
  ajax in arms the first renown acquired,
  while stern achilles in his wrath retired
   his was the strength that mortal might exceeds,
  and his the unrivall'd race of heavenly steeds
  but thetis' son now shines in arms no more
  his troops, neglected on the sandy shore.
  in empty air their sportive javelins throw,
  or whirl the disk, or bend an idle bow
  unstain'd with blood his cover'd chariots stand
  the immortal coursers graze along the strand
  but the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored,
  and, wandering o'er the camp, required their lord.
  now, like a deluge, covering all around,
  the shining armies sweep along the ground
  swift as a flood of fire, when storms arise,
  floats the wild field, and blazes to the skies.
  earth groan'd beneath them  as when angry jove
  hurls down the forky lightning from above,
  on arime when he the thunder throws,
  and fires typhoeus with redoubled blows,
  where typhon, press'd beneath the burning load,
  still feels the fury of the avenging god.
  but various iris, jove's commands to bear,
  speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air
  in priam's porch the trojan chiefs she found,
  the old consulting, and the youths around.
  polites' shape, the monarch's son, she chose,
  who from  setes' tomb observed the foes,
  high on the mound  from whence in prospect lay
  the fields, the tents, the navy, and the bay.
  in this dissembled form, she hastes to bring
  the unwelcome message to the phrygian king.
   cease to consult, the time for action calls
  war, horrid war, approaches to your walls!
  assembled armies oft have i beheld
  but ne'er till now such numbers charged a field
  thick as autumnal leaves or driving sand,
  the moving squadrons blacken all the strand.
  thou, godlike hector! all thy force employ,
  assemble all the united bands of troy
  in just array let every leader call
  the foreign troops  this day demands them all!
  the voice divine the mighty chief alarms
  the council breaks, the warriors rush to arms.
  the gates unfolding pour forth all their train,
  nations on nations fill the dusky plain,
  men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground
  the tumult thickens, and the skies resound.
  amidst the plain, in sight of ilion, stands
  a rising mount, the work of human hands
   this for myrinne's tomb the immortals know,
  though call'd bateia in the world below
  beneath their chiefs in martial order here,
  the auxiliar troops and trojan hosts appear.
  the godlike hector, high above the rest,
  shakes his huge spear, and nods his plumy crest
  in throngs around his native bands repair,
  and groves of lances glitter in the air.
  divine  neas brings the dardan race,
  anchises' son, by venus' stolen embrace,
  born in the shades of ida's secret grove
   a mortal mixing with the queen of love
  archilochus and acamas divide
  the warrior's toils, and combat by his side.
  who fair zeleia's wealthy valleys till,
  fast by the foot of ida's sacred hill,
  or drink,  sepus, of thy sable flood,
  were led by pandarus, of royal blood
  to whom his art apollo deign'd to show,
  graced with the presents of his shafts and bow.
  from rich apaesus and adrestia's towers,
  high teree's summits, and pityea's bowers
  from these the congregated troops obey
  young amphius and adrastus' equal sway
  old merops' sons  whom, skill'd in fates to come,
  the sire forewarn'd, and prophesied their doom
  fate urged them on! the sire forewarn'd in vain,
  they rush'd to war, and perish'd on the plain.
  from practius' stream, percote's pasture lands,
  and sestos and abydos' neighbouring strands,
  from great arisba's walls and selle's coast,
  asius hyrtacides conducts his host
  high on his car he shakes the flowing reins,
  his fiery coursers thunder o'er the plains.
  the fierce pelasgi next, in war renown'd,
  march from larissa's ever-fertile ground
  in equal arms their brother leaders shine,
  hippothous bold, and pyleus the divine.
  next acamas and pyrous lead their hosts,
  in dread array, from thracia's wintry coasts
  round the bleak realms where hellespontus roars,
  and boreas beats the hoarse-resounding shores.
  with great euphemus the ciconians move,
  sprung from troezenian ceus, loved by jove.
  pyraechmes the paeonian troops attend,
  skill'd in the fight their crooked bows to bend
  from axius' ample bed he leads them on,
  axius, that laves the distant amydon,
  axius, that swells with all his neighbouring rills,
  and wide around the floating region fills.
  the paphlagonians pylaemenes rules,
  where rich henetia breeds her savage mules,
  where erythinus' rising cliffs are seen,
  thy groves of box, cytorus! ever green,
  and where  gialus and cromna lie,
  and lofty sesamus invades the sky,
  and where parthenius, roll'd through banks of flowers,
  reflects her bordering palaces and bowers.
  here march'd in arms the halizonian band,
  whom odius and epistrophus command,
  from those far regions where the sun refines
  the ripening silver in alybean mines.
  there mighty chromis led the mysian train,
  and augur ennomus, inspired in vain
  for stern achilles lopp'd his sacred head,
  roll'd down scamander with the vulgar dead.
  phorcys and brave ascanius here unite
  the ascanian phrygians, eager for the fight.
  of those who round maeonia's realms reside,
  or whom the vales in shades of tmolus hide,
  mestles and antiphus the charge partake,
  born on the banks of gyges' silent lake.
  there, from the fields where wild maeander flows,
  high mycale, and latmos' shady brows,
  and proud miletus, came the carian throngs,
  with mingled clamours and with barbarous tongues.
  amphimachus and naustes guide the train,
  naustes the bold, amphimachus the vain,
  who, trick'd with gold, and glittering on his car,
  rode like a woman to the field of war.
  fool that he was! by fierce achilles slain,
  the river swept him to the briny main
  there whelm'd with waves the gaudy warrior lies
  the valiant victor seized the golden prize.
  the forces last in fair array succeed,
  which blameless glaucus and sarpedon lead
  the warlike bands that distant lycia yields,
  where gulfy xanthus foams along the fields.
book iii.
argument.
the duel of menelaus and paris.
the armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon between
menelaus and paris  by the intervention of hector  for the determination
of the war. iris is sent to call helen to behold the fight. she leads her
to the walls of troy, where priam sat with his counsellers observing the
grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom helen gives an account of the
chief of them. the kings on either part take the solemn oath for the
conditions of the combat. the duel ensues  wherein paris being overcome,
he is snatched away in a cloud by venus, and transported to his apartment.
she then calls helen from the walls, and brings the lovers together.
agamemnon, on the part of the grecians, demands the restoration of helen,
and the performance of the articles.
the three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. the
scene is sometimes in the fields before troy, and sometimes in troy
itself.
  thus by their leaders' care each martial band
  moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.
  with shouts the trojans, rushing from afar,
  proclaim their motions, and provoke the war
  so when inclement winters vex the plain
  with piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,
  to warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,
  with noise, and order, through the midway sky
  to pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,
  and all the war descends upon the wing,
  but silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill'd
  by mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,
  swift march the greeks  the rapid dust around
  darkening arises from the labour'd ground.
  thus from his flaggy wings when notus sheds
  a night of vapours round the mountain heads,
  swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,
  to thieves more grateful than the midnight shade
  while scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,
  lost and confused amidst the thicken'd day
  so wrapp'd in gathering dust, the grecian train,
  a moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.
  now front to front the hostile armies stand,
  eager of fight, and only wait command
  when, to the van, before the sons of fame
  whom troy sent forth, the beauteous paris came
  in form a god! the panther's speckled hide
  flow'd o'er his armour with an easy pride
  his bended bow across his shoulders flung,
  his sword beside him negligently hung
  two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,
  and dared the bravest of the grecian race.
  as thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,
  he boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain,
  him menelaus, loved of mars, espies,
  with heart elated, and with joyful eyes
  so joys a lion, if the branching deer,
  or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear
  eager he seizes and devours the slain,
  press'd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.
  thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,
  in clanging arms he leaps upon the ground
  from his high chariot  him, approaching near,
  the beauteous champion views with marks of fear,
  smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,
  and shuns the fate he well deserved to find.
  as when some shepherd, from the rustling trees
  shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,
  trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright
  and all confused precipitates his flight
  so from the king the shining warrior flies,
  and plunged amid the thickest trojans lies.
  as godlike hector sees the prince retreat,
  he thus upbraids him with a generous heat
   unhappy paris! but to women brave!
  so fairly form'd, and only to deceive!
  oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw'st the light,
  or died at least before thy nuptial rite!
  a better fate than vainly thus to boast,
  and fly, the scandal of thy trojan host.
  gods! how the scornful greeks exult to see
  their fears of danger undeceived in thee!
  thy figure promised with a martial air,
  but ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.
  in former days, in all thy gallant pride,
  when thy tall ships triumphant stemm'd the tide,
  when greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,
  and crowds stood wondering at the passing show,
  say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,
  you met the approaches of the spartan queen,
  thus from her realm convey'd the beauteous prize,
  and both her warlike lords outshined in helen's eyes?
  this deed, thy foes' delight, thy own disgrace,
  thy father's grief, and ruin of thy race
  this deed recalls thee to the proffer'd fight
  or hast thou injured whom thou dar'st not right?
  soon to thy cost the field would make thee know
  thou keep'st the consort of a braver foe.
  thy graceful form instilling soft desire,
  thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,
  beauty and youth  in vain to these you trust,
  when youth and beauty shall be laid in dust
  troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow
  crush the dire author of his country's woe.
  his silence here, with blushes, paris breaks
   'tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks
  but who like thee can boast a soul sedate,
  so firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?
  thy force, like steel, a temper'd hardness shows,
  still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,
  like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,
  with falling woods to strew the wasted plain.
  thy gifts i praise  nor thou despise the charms
  with which a lover golden venus arms
  soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,
  no wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.
  yet, would'st thou have the proffer'd combat stand,
  the greeks and trojans seat on either hand
  then let a midway space our hosts divide,
  and, on that stage of war, the cause be tried
  by paris there the spartan king be fought,
  for beauteous helen and the wealth she brought
  and who his rival can in arms subdue,
  his be the fair, and his the treasure too.
  thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,
  and troy possess her fertile fields in peace
  thus may the greeks review their native shore,
  much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.
  he said. the challenge hector heard with joy,
  then with his spear restrain'd the youth of troy,
  held by the midst, athwart  and near the foe
  advanced with steps majestically slow
  while round his dauntless head the grecians pour
  their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.
  then thus the monarch, great atrides, cried
   forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside
  a parley hector asks, a message bears
  we know him by the various plume he wears.
  awed by his high command the greeks attend,
  the tumult silence, and the fight suspend.
  while from the centre hector rolls his eyes
  on either host, and thus to both applies
   hear, all ye trojan, all ye grecian bands,
  what paris, author of the war, demands.
  your shining swords within the sheath restrain,
  and pitch your lances in the yielding plain.
  here in the midst, in either army's sight,
  he dares the spartan king to single fight
  and wills that helen and the ravish'd spoil,
  that caused the contest, shall reward the toil.
  let these the brave triumphant victor grace,
  and different nations part in leagues of peace.
  he spoke  in still suspense on either side
  each army stood  the spartan chief replied
   me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right
  a world engages in the toils of fight.
  to me the labour of the field resign
  me paris injured  all the war be mine.
  fall he that must, beneath his rival's arms
  and live the rest, secure of future harms.
  two lambs, devoted by your country's rite,
  to earth a sable, to the sun a white,
  prepare, ye trojans! while a third we bring
  select to jove, the inviolable king.
  let reverend priam in the truce engage,
  and add the sanction of considerate age
  his sons are faithless, headlong in debate,
  and youth itself an empty wavering state
  cool age advances, venerably wise,
  turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes
  sees what befell, and what may yet befall,
  concludes from both, and best provides for all.
  the nations hear with rising hopes possess'd,
  and peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.
  within the lines they drew their steeds around,
  and from their chariots issued on the ground
  next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,
  laid their bright arms along the sable shore.
  on either side the meeting hosts are seen
  with lances fix'd, and close the space between.
  two heralds now, despatch'd to troy, invite
  the phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.
  talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring
  the lamb for jove, the inviolable king.
  meantime to beauteous helen, from the skies
  the various goddess of the rainbow flies
   like fair laodice in form and face,
  the loveliest nymph of priam's royal race
  her in the palace, at her loom she found
  the golden web her own sad story crown'd,
  the trojan wars she weaved  herself the prize
  and the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.
  to whom the goddess of the painted bow
   approach, and view the wondrous scene below!
  each hardy greek, and valiant trojan knight,
  so dreadful late, and furious for the fight,
  now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields
  ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.
  paris alone and sparta's king advance,
  in single fight to toss the beamy lance
  each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,
  thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize.
  this said, the many-coloured maid inspires
  her husband's love, and wakes her former fires
  her country, parents, all that once were dear,
  rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,
  o'er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,
  and, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.
  her handmaids, clymene and  thra, wait
  her silent footsteps to the scaean gate.
  there sat the seniors of the trojan race
   old priam's chiefs, and most in priam's grace,
  the king the first  thymoetes at his side
  lampus and clytius, long in council tried
  panthus, and hicetaon, once the strong
  and next, the wisest of the reverend throng,
  antenor grave, and sage ucalegon,
  lean'd on the walls and bask'd before the sun
  chiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,
  but wise through time, and narrative with age,
  in summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,
  a bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.
  these, when the spartan queen approach'd the tower,
  in secret own'd resistless beauty's power
  they cried,  no wonder such celestial charms
  for nine long years have set the world in arms
  what winning graces! what majestic mien!
  she moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!
  yet hence, o heaven, convey that fatal face,
  and from destruction save the trojan race.
  the good old priam welcomed her, and cried,
   approach, my child, and grace thy father's side.
  see on the plain thy grecian spouse appears,
  the friends and kindred of thy former years.
  no crime of thine our present sufferings draws,
  not thou, but heaven's disposing will, the cause
  the gods these armies and this force employ,
  the hostile gods conspire the fate of troy.
  but lift thy eyes, and say, what greek is he
   far as from hence these aged orbs can see
  around whose brow such martial graces shine,
  so tall, so awful, and almost divine!
  though some of larger stature tread the green,
  none match his grandeur and exalted mien
  he seems a monarch, and his country's pride.
  thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied
   before thy presence, father, i appear,
  with conscious shame and reverential fear.
  ah! had i died, ere to these walk i fled,
  false to my country, and my nuptial bed
  my brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,
  false to them all, to paris only kind!
  for this i mourn, till grief or dire disease
  shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!
  the king of kings, atrides, you survey,
  great in the war, and great in arts of sway
  my brother once, before my days of shame!
  and oh! that still he bore a brother's name!
  with wonder priam view'd the godlike man,
  extoll'd the happy prince, and thus began
   o bless'd atrides! born to prosperous fate,
  successful monarch of a mighty state!
  how vast thy empire! of your matchless train
  what numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!
  in phrygia once were gallant armies known,
  in ancient time, when otreus fill'd the throne,
  when godlike mygdon led their troops of horse,
  and i, to join them, raised the trojan force
  against the manlike amazons we stood,
  and sangar's stream ran purple with their blood.
  but far inferior those, in martial grace,
  and strength of numbers, to this grecian race.
  this said, once more he view'd the warrior train
   what's he, whose arms lie scatter'd on the plain?
  broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,
  though great atrides overtops his head.
  nor yet appear his care and conduct small
  from rank to rank he moves, and orders all.
  the stately ram thus measures o'er the ground,
  and, master of the flock, surveys them round.
  then helen thus   whom your discerning eyes
  have singled out, is ithacus the wise
  a barren island boasts his glorious birth
  his fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.
  antenor took the word, and thus began
   myself, o king! have seen that wondrous man
  when, trusting jove and hospitable laws,
  to troy he came, to plead the grecian cause
   great menelaus urged the same request
  my house was honour'd with each royal guest
  i knew their persons, and admired their parts,
  both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.
  erect, the spartan most engaged our view
  ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.
  when atreus' son harangued the listening train,
  just was his sense, and his expression plain,
  his words succinct, yet full, without a fault
  he spoke no more than just the thing he ought.
  but when ulysses rose, in thought profound,
  his modest eyes he fix'd upon the ground
  as one unskill'd or dumb, he seem'd to stand,
  nor raised his head, nor stretch'd his sceptred hand
  but, when he speaks, what elocution flows!
  soft as the fleeces of descending snows,
  the copious accents fall, with easy art
  melting they fall, and sink into the heart!
  wondering we hear, and fix'd in deep surprise,
  our ears refute the censure of our eyes.
  the king then ask'd  as yet the camp he view'd
   what chief is that, with giant strength endued,
  whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,
  and lofty stature, far exceed the rest?
   ajax the great,  the beauteous queen replied,
  himself a host  the grecian strength and pride.
  see! bold idomeneus superior towers
  amid yon circle of his cretan powers,
  great as a god! i saw him once before,
  with menelaus on the spartan shore.
  the rest i know, and could in order name
  all valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.
  yet two are wanting of the numerous train,
  whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain
  castor and pollux, first in martial force,
  one bold on foot, and one renown'd for horse.
  my brothers these  the same our native shore,
  one house contain'd us, as one mother bore.
  perhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,
  for distant troy refused to sail the seas
  perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,
  ashamed to combat in their sister's cause.
  so spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers' doom
  wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb
  adorn'd with honours in their native shore,
  silent they slept, and heard of wars no more.
  meantime the heralds, through the crowded town.
  bring the rich wine and destined victims down.
  idaeus' arms the golden goblets press'd,
  who thus the venerable king address'd
   arise, o father of the trojan state!
  the nations call, thy joyful people wait
  to seal the truce, and end the dire debate.
  paris, thy son, and sparta's king advance,
  in measured lists to toss the weighty lance
  and who his rival shall in arms subdue,
  his be the dame, and his the treasure too.
  thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,
  and troy possess her fertile fields in peace
  so shall the greeks review their native shore,
  much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.
  with grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare
  to join his milk-white coursers to the car
  he mounts the seat, antenor at his side
  the gentle steeds through scaea's gates they guide
  next from the car descending on the plain,
  amid the grecian host and trojan train,
  slow they proceed  the sage ulysses then
  arose, and with him rose the king of men.
  on either side a sacred herald stands,
  the wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands
  pour the full urn  then draws the grecian lord
  his cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword
  from the sign'd victims crops the curling hair
  the heralds part it, and the princes share
  then loudly thus before the attentive bands
  he calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands
   o first and greatest power! whom all obey,
  who high on ida's holy mountain sway,
  eternal jove! and you bright orb that roll
  from east to west, and view from pole to pole!
  thou mother earth! and all ye living floods!
  infernal furies, and tartarean gods,
  who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare
  for perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!
  hear, and be witness. if, by paris slain,
  great menelaus press the fatal plain
  the dame and treasures let the trojan keep,
  and greece returning plough the watery deep.
  if by my brother's lance the trojan bleed,
  be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed
  the appointed fine let ilion justly pay,
  and every age record the signal day.
  this if the phrygians shall refuse to yield,
  arms must revenge, and mars decide the field.
  with that the chief the tender victims slew,
  and in the dust their bleeding bodies threw
  the vital spirit issued at the wound,
  and left the members quivering on the ground.
  from the same urn they drink the mingled wine,
  and add libations to the powers divine.
  while thus their prayers united mount the sky,
   hear, mighty jove! and hear, ye gods on high!
  and may their blood, who first the league confound,
  shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground
  may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,
  and all their lust be scatter'd as the dust!
  thus either host their imprecations join'd,
  which jove refused, and mingled with the wind.
  the rites now finish'd, reverend priam rose,
  and thus express'd a heart o'ercharged with woes
   ye greeks and trojans, let the chiefs engage,
  but spare the weakness of my feeble age
  in yonder walls that object let me shun,
  nor view the danger of so dear a son.
  whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,
  heaven only knows  for heaven disposes all.
  this said, the hoary king no longer stay'd,
  but on his car the slaughter'd victims laid
  then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,
  and drove to troy, antenor at his side.
  bold hector and ulysses now dispose
  the lists of combat, and the ground inclose
  next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,
  who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.
  the people pray with elevated hands,
  and words like these are heard through all the bands
   immortal jove, high heaven's superior lord,
  on lofty ida's holy mount adored!
  whoe'er involved us in this dire debate,
  o give that author of the war to fate
  and shades eternal! let division cease,
  and joyful nations join in leagues of peace.
  with eyes averted hector hastes to turn
  the lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.
  then, paris, thine leap'd forth  by fatal chance
  ordain'd the first to whirl the weighty lance.
  both armies sat the combat to survey.
  beside each chief his azure armour lay,
  and round the lists the generous coursers neigh.
  the beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,
  in gilded arms magnificently bright
  the purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,
  with flowers adorn'd, with silver buckles bound
  lycaon's corslet his fair body dress'd,
  braced in and fitted to his softer breast
  a radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,
  sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side
  his youthful face a polish'd helm o'erspread
  the waving horse-hair nodded on his head
  his figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,
  and in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.
  with equal speed and fired by equal charms,
  the spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.
  now round the lists the admiring armies stand,
  with javelins fix'd, the greek and trojan band.
  amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,
  all pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.
  the trojan first his shining javelin threw
  full on atrides' ringing shield it flew,
  nor pierced the brazen orb, but with a bound
  leap'd from the buckler, blunted, on the ground.
  atrides then his massy lance prepares,
  in act to throw, but first prefers his prayers
   give me, great jove! to punish lawless lust,
  and lay the trojan gasping in the dust
  destroy the aggressor, aid my righteous cause,
  avenge the breach of hospitable laws!
  let this example future times reclaim,
  and guard from wrong fair friendship's holy name.
  be said, and poised in air the javelin sent,
  through paris' shield the forceful weapon went,
  his corslet pierces, and his garment rends,
  and glancing downward, near his flank descends.
  the wary trojan, bending from the blow,
  eludes the death, and disappoints his foe
  but fierce atrides waved his sword, and strook
  full on his casque  the crested helmet shook
  the brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand,
  broke short  the fragments glitter'd on the sand.
  the raging warrior to the spacious skies
  raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes
   then is it vain in jove himself to trust?
  and is it thus the gods assist the just?
  when crimes provoke us, heaven success denies
  the dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies.
  furious he said, and towards the grecian crew
   seized by the crest  the unhappy warrior drew
  struggling he followed, while the embroider'd thong
  that tied his helmet, dragg'd the chief along.
  then had his ruin crown'd atrides' joy,
  but venus trembled for the prince of troy
  unseen she came, and burst the golden band
  and left an empty helmet in his hand.
  the casque, enraged, amidst the greeks he threw
  the greeks with smiles the polish'd trophy view.
  then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart,
  in thirst of vengeance, at his rival's heart
  the queen of love her favour'd champion shrouds
   for gods can all things  in a veil of clouds.
  raised from the field the panting youth she led,
  and gently laid him on the bridal bed,
  with pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews,
  and all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews.
  meantime the brightest of the female kind,
  the matchless helen, o'er the walls reclined
  to her, beset with trojan beauties, came,
  in borrow'd form, the laughter-loving dame.
   she seem'd an ancient maid, well-skill'd to cull
  the snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool.
  the goddess softly shook her silken vest,
  that shed perfumes, and whispering thus address'd
   haste, happy nymph! for thee thy paris calls,
  safe from the fight, in yonder lofty walls,
  fair as a god  with odours round him spread,
  he lies, and waits thee on the well-known bed
  not like a warrior parted from the foe,
  but some gay dancer in the public show.
  she spoke, and helen's secret soul was moved
  she scorn'd the champion, but the man she loved.
  fair venus' neck, her eyes that sparkled fire,
  and breast, reveal'd the queen of soft desire.
  struck with her presence, straight the lively red
  forsook her cheek  and trembling, thus she said
   then is it still thy pleasure to deceive?
  and woman's frailty always to believe!
  say, to new nations must i cross the main,
  or carry wars to some soft asian plain?
  for whom must helen break her second vow?
  what other paris is thy darling now?
  left to atrides,  victor in the strife,
  an odious conquest and a captive wife,
  hence let me sail  and if thy paris bear
  my absence ill, let venus ease his care.
  a handmaid goddess at his side to wait,
  renounce the glories of thy heavenly state,
  be fix'd for ever to the trojan shore,
  his spouse, or slave  and mount the skies no more.
  for me, to lawless love no longer led,
  i scorn the coward, and detest his bed
  else should i merit everlasting shame,
  and keen reproach, from every phrygian dame
  ill suits it now the joys of love to know,
  too deep my anguish, and too wild my woe.
  then thus incensed, the paphian queen replies
   obey the power from whom thy glories rise
  should venus leave thee, every charm must fly,
  fade from thy cheek, and languish in thy eye.
  cease to provoke me, lest i make thee more
  the world's aversion, than their love before
  now the bright prize for which mankind engage,
  than, the sad victim, of the public rage.
  at this, the fairest of her sex obey'd,
  and veil'd her blushes in a silken shade
  unseen, and silent, from the train she moves,
  led by the goddess of the smiles and loves.
  arrived, and enter'd at the palace gate,
  the maids officious round their mistress wait
  then, all dispersing, various tasks attend
  the queen and goddess to the prince ascend.
  full in her paris' sight, the queen of love
  had placed the beauteous progeny of jove
  where, as he view'd her charms, she turn'd away
  her glowing eyes, and thus began to say
   is this the chief, who, lost to sense of shame,
  late fled the field, and yet survives his fame?
  o hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword
  of that brave man whom once i call'd my lord!
  the boaster paris oft desired the day
  with sparta's king to meet in single fray
  go now, once more thy rival's rage excite,
  provoke atrides, and renew the fight
  yet helen bids thee stay, lest thou unskill'd
  shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field.
  the prince replies   ah cease, divinely fair,
  nor add reproaches to the wounds i bear
  this day the foe prevail'd by pallas' power
  we yet may vanquish in a happier hour
  there want not gods to favour us above
  but let the business of our life be love
  these softer moments let delights employ,
  and kind embraces snatch the hasty joy.
  not thus i loved thee, when from sparta's shore
  my forced, my willing heavenly prize i bore,
  when first entranced in cranae's isle i lay,
  mix'd with thy soul, and all dissolved away!
  thus having spoke, the enamour'd phrygian boy
  rush'd to the bed, impatient for the joy.
  him helen follow'd slow with bashful charms,
  and clasp'd the blooming hero in her arms.
  while these to love's delicious rapture yield,
  the stern atrides rages round the field
  so some fell lion whom the woods obey,
  roars through the desert, and demands his prey.
  paris he seeks, impatient to destroy,
  but seeks in vain along the troops of troy
  even those had yielded to a foe so brave
  the recreant warrior, hateful as the grave.
  then speaking thus, the king of kings arose,
   ye trojans, dardans, all our generous foes!
  hear and attest! from heaven with conquest crown'd,
  our brother's arms the just success have found
  be therefore now the spartan wealth restor'd,
  let argive helen own her lawful lord
  the appointed fine let ilion justly pay,
  and age to age record this signal day.
  he ceased  his army's loud applauses rise,
  and the long shout runs echoing through the skies.
  and now olympus' shining gates unfold
  the gods, with jove, assume their thrones of gold
  immortal hebe, fresh with bloom divine,
  the golden goblet crowns with purple wine
  while the full bowls flow round, the powers employ
  their careful eyes on long-contended troy.
  when jove, disposed to tempt saturnia's spleen,
  thus waked the fury of his partial queen,
   two powers divine the son of atreus aid,
  imperial juno, and the martial maid
  but high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,
  the tame spectators of his deeds of war.
  not thus fair venus helps her favour'd knight,
  the queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,
  each danger wards, and constant in her care,
  saves in the moment of the last despair.
  her act has rescued paris' forfeit life,
  though great atrides gain'd the glorious strife.
  then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits
  to crown this deed, and finish all the fates!
  shall heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,
  or rouse the furies, and awake the war?
  yet, would the gods for human good provide,
  atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,
  still priam's walls in peaceful honours grow,
  and through his gates the crowding nations flow.
  thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,
  and queen of war, in close consult engaged
  apart they sit, their deep designs employ,
  and meditate the future woes of troy.
  though secret anger swell'd minerva's breast,
  the prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd
  but juno, impotent of passion, broke
  her sullen silence, and with fury spoke
   shall then, o tyrant of the ethereal reign!
  my schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?
  have i, for this, shook ilion with alarms,
  assembled nations, set two worlds in arms?
  to spread the war, i flew from shore to shore
  the immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.
  at length ripe vengeance o'er their heads impends,
  but jove himself the faithless race defends.
  loth as thou art to punish lawless lust,
  not all the gods are partial and unjust.
  the sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies,
  sighs from his inmost soul, and thus replies
   oh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate
  to phrygia's monarch, and the phrygian state!
  what high offence has fired the wife of jove?
  can wretched mortals harm the powers above,
  that troy, and troy's whole race thou wouldst confound,
  and yon fair structures level with the ground!
  haste, leave the skies, fulfil thy stern desire,
  burst all her gates, and wrap her walls in fire!
  let priam bleed! if yet you thirst for more,
  bleed all his sons, and ilion float with gore
  to boundless vengeance the wide realm be given,
  till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven!
  so let it be, and jove his peace enjoy,
  when heaven no longer hears the name of troy.
  but should this arm prepare to wreak our hate
  on thy loved realms, whose guilt demands their fate
  presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay,
  remember troy, and give the vengeance way.
  for know, of all the numerous towns that rise
  beneath the rolling sun and starry skies,
  which gods have raised, or earth-born men enjoy,
  none stands so dear to jove as sacred troy.
  no mortals merit more distinguish'd grace
  than godlike priam, or than priam's race.
  still to our name their hecatombs expire,
  and altars blaze with unextinguish'd fire.
  at this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,
  then on the thunderer fix'd them, and replies
   three towns are juno's on the grecian plains,
  more dear than all the extended earth contains,
  mycenae, argos, and the spartan wall
  these thou mayst raze, nor i forbid their fall
  'tis not in me the vengeance to remove
  the crime's sufficient that they share my love.
  of power superior why should i complain?
  resent i may, but must resent in vain.
  yet some distinction juno might require,
  sprung with thyself from one celestial sire,
  a goddess born, to share the realms above,
  and styled the consort of the thundering jove
  nor thou a wife and sister's right deny
  let both consent, and both by terms comply
  so shall the gods our joint decrees obey,
  and heaven shall act as we direct the way.
  see ready pallas waits thy high commands
  to raise in arms the greek and phrygian bands
  their sudden friendship by her arts may cease,
  and the proud trojans first infringe the peace.
  the sire of men and monarch of the sky
  the advice approved, and bade minerva fly,
  dissolve the league, and all her arts employ
  to make the breach the faithless act of troy.
  fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,
  and shot like lightning from olympus' height.
  as the red comet, from saturnius sent
  to fright the nations with a dire portent,
   a fatal sign to armies on the plain,
  or trembling sailors on the wintry main,
  with sweeping glories glides along in air,
  and shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair
  between both armies thus, in open sight
  shot the bright goddess in a trail of light,
  with eyes erect the gazing hosts admire
  the power descending, and the heavens on fire!
   the gods  they cried , the gods this signal sent,
  and fate now labours with some vast event
  jove seals the league, or bloodier scenes prepares
  jove, the great arbiter of peace and wars.
  they said, while pallas through the trojan throng,
   in shape a mortal,  pass'd disguised along.
  like bold laodocus, her course she bent,
  who from antenor traced his high descent.
  amidst the ranks lycaon's son she found,
  the warlike pandarus, for strength renown'd
  whose squadrons, led from black  sepus' flood,
  with flaming shields in martial circle stood.
  to him the goddess   phrygian! canst thou hear
  a well-timed counsel with a willing ear?
  what praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart,
  amidst his triumph, to the spartan's heart?
  what gifts from troy, from paris wouldst thou gain,
  thy country's foe, the grecian glory slain?
  then seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed,
  aim at his breast, and may that aim succeed!
  but first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow
  to lycian phoebus with the silver bow,
  and swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay,
  on zelia's altars, to the god of day.
  he heard, and madly at the motion pleased,
  his polish'd bow with hasty rashness seized.
  'twas form'd of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil
  a mountain goat resign'd the shining spoil.
  who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled
  the stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead,
  and sixteen palms his brow's large honours spread
  the workmen join'd, and shaped the bended horns,
  and beaten gold each taper point adorns.
  this, by the greeks unseen, the warrior bends,
  screen'd by the shields of his surrounding friends
  there meditates the mark  and couching low,
  fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.
  one from a hundred feather'd deaths he chose,
  fated to wound, and cause of future woes
  then offers vows with hecatombs to crown
  apollo's altars in his native town.
  now with full force the yielding horn he bends,
  drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends
  close to his breast he strains the nerve below,
  till the barb'd points approach the circling bow
  the impatient weapon whizzes on the wing
  sounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string.
  but thee, atrides! in that dangerous hour
  the gods forget not, nor thy guardian power,
  pallas assists, and  weakened in its force
  diverts the weapon from its destined course
  so from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,
  the watchful mother wafts the envenom'd fly.
  just where his belt with golden buckles join'd,
  where linen folds the double corslet lined,
  she turn'd the shaft, which, hissing from above,
  pass'd the broad belt, and through the corslet drove
  the folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,
  and razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.
  as when some stately trappings are decreed
  to grace a monarch on his bounding steed,
  a nymph in caria or maeonia bred,
  stains the pure ivory with a lively red
  with equal lustre various colours vie,
  the shining whiteness, and the tyrian dye
  so great atrides! show'd thy sacred blood,
  as down thy snowy thigh distill'd the streaming flood.
  with horror seized, the king of men descried
  the shaft infix'd, and saw the gushing tide
  nor less the spartan fear'd, before he found
  the shining barb appear above the wound,
  then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,
  the royal brother thus his grief express'd,
  and grasp'd his hand  while all the greeks around
  with answering sighs return'd the plaintive sound.
   oh, dear as life! did i for this agree
  the solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!
  wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,
  to fight for greece, and conquer, to be slain!
  the race of trojans in thy ruin join,
  and faith is scorn'd by all the perjured line.
  not thus our vows, confirm'd with wine and gore,
  those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,
  shall all be vain  when heaven's revenge is slow,
  jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.
  the day shall come, that great avenging day,
  when troy's proud glories in the dust shall lay,
  when priam's powers and priam's self shall fall,
  and one prodigious ruin swallow all.
  i see the god, already, from the pole
  bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll
  i see the eternal all his fury shed,
  and shake his aegis o'er their guilty head.
  such mighty woes on perjured princes wait
  but thou, alas! deserv'st a happier fate.
  still must i mourn the period of thy days,
  and only mourn, without my share of praise?
  deprived of thee, the heartless greeks no more
  shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore
  troy seized of helen, and our glory lost,
  thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast
  while some proud trojan thus insulting cries,
   and spurns the dust where menelaus lies,
  'such are the trophies greece from ilion brings,
  and such the conquest of her king of kings!
  lo his proud vessels scatter'd o'er the main,
  and unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.'
  oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,
  o'erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch's shame.
  he said  a leader's and a brother's fears
  possess his soul, which thus the spartan cheers
   let not thy words the warmth of greece abate
  the feeble dart is guiltless of my fate
  stiff with the rich embroider'd work around,
  my varied belt repell'd the flying wound.
  to whom the king   my brother and my friend,
  thus, always thus, may heaven thy life defend!
  now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art
  may stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.
  herald, be swift, and bid machaon bring
  his speedy succour to the spartan king
  pierced with a winged shaft  the deed of troy ,
  the grecian's sorrow, and the dardan's joy.
  with hasty zeal the swift talthybius flies
  through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,
  and finds machaon, where sublime he stands
  in arms incircled with his native bands.
  then thus   machaon, to the king repair,
  his wounded brother claims thy timely care
  pierced by some lycian or dardanian bow,
  a grief to us, a triumph to the foe.
  the heavy tidings grieved the godlike man
  swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.
  the dauntless king yet standing firm he found,
  and all the chiefs in deep concern around.
  where to the steely point the reed was join'd,
  the shaft he drew, but left the head behind.
  straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,
  he loosed  the corslet from his breast unbraced
  then suck'd the blood, and sovereign balm infused,
  which chiron gave, and  sculapius used.
  while round the prince the greeks employ their care,
  the trojans rush tumultuous to the war
  once more they glitter in refulgent arms,
  once more the fields are fill'd with dire alarms.
  nor had you seen the king of men appear
  confused, unactive, or surprised with fear
  but fond of glory, with severe delight,
  his beating bosom claim'd the rising fight.
  no longer with his warlike steeds he stay'd,
  or press'd the car with polish'd brass inlaid
  but left eurymedon the reins to guide
  the fiery coursers snorted at his side.
  on foot through all the martial ranks he moves
  and these encourages, and those reproves.
   brave men!  he cries,  to such who boldly dare
  urge their swift steeds to face the coming war ,
   your ancient valour on the foes approve
  jove is with greece, and let us trust in jove.
  'tis not for us, but guilty troy, to dread,
  whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head
  her sons and matrons greece shall lead in chains,
  and her dead warriors strew the mournful plains.
  thus with new ardour he the brave inspires
  or thus the fearful with reproaches fires
   shame to your country, scandal of your kind
  born to the fate ye well deserve to find!
  why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,
  prepared for flight, but doom'd to fly in vain?
  confused and panting thus, the hunted deer
  falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.
  still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,
  till yon tall vessels blaze with trojan fire?
  or trust ye, jove a valiant foe shall chase,
  to save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?
  this said, he stalk'd with ample strides along,
  to crete's brave monarch and his martial throng
  high at their head he saw the chief appear,
  and bold meriones excite the rear.
  at this the king his generous joy express'd,
  and clasp'd the warrior to his armed breast.
   divine idomeneus! what thanks we owe
  to worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?
  to thee the foremost honours are decreed,
  first in the fight and every graceful deed.
  for this, in banquets, when the generous bowls
  restore our blood, and raise the warriors' souls,
  though all the rest with stated rules we bound,
  unmix'd, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown'd.
  be still thyself, in arms a mighty name
  maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame.
  to whom the cretan thus his speech address'd
   secure of me, o king! exhort the rest.
  fix'd to thy side, in every toil i share,
  thy firm associate in the day of war.
  but let the signal be this moment given
  to mix in fight is all i ask of heaven.
  the field shall prove how perjuries succeed,
  and chains or death avenge the impious deed.
  charm'd with this heat, the king his course pursues,
  and next the troops of either ajax views
  in one firm orb the bands were ranged around,
  a cloud of heroes blacken'd all the ground.
  thus from the lofty promontory's brow
  a swain surveys the gathering storm below
  slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,
  spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,
  till black as night the swelling tempest shows,
  the cloud condensing as the west-wind blows
  he dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock
  to the close covert of an arching rock.
  such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,
  with spears erect, a moving iron wood
  a shady light was shot from glimmering shields,
  and their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.
   o heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,
  whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,
   exclaim'd the king , who raise your eager bands
  with great examples, more than loud commands.
  ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest
  such souls as burn in your exalted breast,
  soon should our arms with just success be crown'd,
  and troy's proud walls lie smoking on the ground.
  then to the next the general bends his course
   his heart exults, and glories in his force
  there reverend nestor ranks his pylian bands,
  and with inspiring eloquence commands
  with strictest order sets his train in arms,
  the chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.
  alastor, chromius, haemon, round him wait,
  bias the good, and pelagon the great.
  the horse and chariots to the front assign'd,
  the foot  the strength of war  he ranged behind
  the middle space suspected troops supply,
  inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly
  he gives command to  curb the fiery steed,
  nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed
  before the rest let none too rashly ride
  no strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried
  the charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,
  but fight, or fall  a firm embodied train.
  he whom the fortune of the field shall cast
  from forth his chariot, mount the next in haste
  nor seek unpractised to direct the car,
  content with javelins to provoke the war.
  our great forefathers held this prudent course,
  thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force
  by laws like these immortal conquests made,
  and earth's proud tyrants low in ashes laid.
  so spoke the master of the martial art,
  and touch'd with transport great atrides' heart.
   oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,
  and nerves to second what thy soul inspires!
  but wasting years, that wither human race,
  exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.
  what once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!
  and age the lot of any chief but thee.
  thus to the experienced prince atrides cried
  he shook his hoary locks, and thus replied
   well might i wish, could mortal wish renew
  that strength which once in boiling youth i knew
  such as i was, when ereuthalion, slain
  beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.
  but heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,
  these years with wisdom crowns, with action those
  the field of combat fits the young and bold,
  the solemn council best becomes the old
  to you the glorious conflict i resign,
  let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine.
  he said. with joy the monarch march'd before,
  and found menestheus on the dusty shore,
  with whom the firm athenian phalanx stands
  and next ulysses, with his subject bands.
  remote their forces lay, nor knew so far
  the peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war
  the tumult late begun, they stood intent
  to watch the motion, dubious of the event.
  the king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,
  with hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved
   can peleus' son forget a warrior's part.
  and fears ulysses, skill'd in every art?
  why stand you distant, and the rest expect
  to mix in combat which yourselves neglect?
  from you 'twas hoped among the first to dare
  the shock of armies, and commence the war
  for this your names are call'd before the rest,
  to share the pleasures of the genial feast
  and can you, chiefs! without a blush survey
  whole troops before you labouring in the fray?
  say, is it thus those honours you requite?
  the first in banquets, but the last in fight.
  ulysses heard  the hero's warmth o'erspread
  his cheek with blushes  and severe, he said
   take back the unjust reproach! behold we stand
  sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.
  if glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,
  behold me plunging in the thickest fight.
  then give thy warrior-chief a warrior's due,
  who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view.
  struck with his generous wrath, the king replies
   o great in action, and in council wise!
  with ours, thy care and ardour are the same,
  nor need i to commend, nor aught to blame.
  sage as thou art, and learn'd in human kind,
  forgive the transport of a martial mind.
  haste to the fight, secure of just amends
  the gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends.
  he said, and pass'd where great tydides lay,
  his steeds and chariots wedged in firm array
   the warlike sthenelus attends his side
  to whom with stern reproach the monarch cried
   o son of tydeus!  he, whose strength could tame
  the bounding steed, in arms a mighty name
  canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,
  with hands unactive, and a careless eye?
  not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd
  still first in front the matchless prince appear'd
  what glorious toils, what wonders they recite,
  who view'd him labouring through the ranks of fight?
  i saw him once, when gathering martial powers,
  a peaceful guest, he sought mycenae's towers
  armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,
  not we denied, but jove forbade from heaven
  while dreadful comets glaring from afar,
  forewarn'd the horrors of the theban war.
  next, sent by greece from where asopus flows,
  a fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes
  thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,
  dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.
  the tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,
  and dared to combat all those chiefs around
  dared, and subdued before their haughty lord
  for pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.
  stung with the shame, within the winding way,
  to bar his passage fifty warriors lay
  two heroes led the secret squadron on,
  mason the fierce, and hardy lycophon
  those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.
  he spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,
  such tydeus was, and such his martial fire
  gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!
  no words the godlike diomed return'd,
  but heard respectful, and in secret burn'd
  not so fierce capaneus' undaunted son
  stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun
   what needs, o monarch! this invidious praise,
  ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?
  dare to be just, atrides! and confess
  our value equal, though our fury less.
  with fewer troops we storm'd the theban wall,
  and happier saw the sevenfold city fall,
  in impious acts the guilty father died
  the sons subdued, for heaven was on their side.
  far more than heirs of all our parents' fame,
  our glories darken their diminish'd name.
  to him tydides thus   my friend, forbear
  suppress thy passion, and the king revere
  his high concern may well excuse this rage,
  whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage
  his the first praise, were ilion's towers o'erthrown,
  and, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.
  let him the greeks to hardy toils excite,
  'tis ours to labour in the glorious fight.
  he spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground
  sprung from his car  his ringing arms resound.
  dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,
  of arm'd tydides rushing to the war.
  as when the winds, ascending by degrees,
  first move the whitening surface of the seas,
  the billows float in order to the shore,
  the wave behind rolls on the wave before
  till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise,
  foam o'er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.
  so to the fight the thick battalions throng,
  shields urged on shields, and men drove men along
  sedate and silent move the numerous bands
  no sound, no whisper, but the chief's commands,
  those only heard  with awe the rest obey,
  as if some god had snatch'd their voice away.
  not so the trojans  from their host ascends
  a general shout that all the region rends.
  as when the fleecy flocks unnumber'd stand
  in wealthy folds, and wait the milker's hand,
  the hollow vales incessant bleating fills,
  the lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills
  such clamours rose from various nations round,
  mix'd was the murmur, and confused the sound.
  each host now joins, and each a god inspires,
  these mars incites, and those minerva fires,
  pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign
  and discord raging bathes the purple plain
  discord! dire sister of the slaughtering power,
  small at her birth, but rising every hour,
  while scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,
  she stalks on earth, and shakes the world around
  the nations bleed, where'er her steps she turns,
  the groan still deepens, and the combat burns.
  now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed,
  to armour armour, lance to lance opposed,
  host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,
  the sounding darts in iron tempests flew,
  victors and vanquish'd join'd promiscuous cries,
  and shrilling shouts and dying groans arise
  with streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,
  and slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
  as torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,
  with rage impetuous, down their echoing hills
  rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain.
  roar through a thousand channels to the main
  the distant shepherd trembling hears the sound
  so mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.
  the bold antilochus the slaughter led,
  the first who struck a valiant trojan dead
  at great echepolus the lance arrives,
  razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives
  warm'd in the brain the brazen weapon lies,
  and shades eternal settle o'er his eyes.
  so sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood
  of force and fire, its walls besmear'd with blood.
  him, the bold leader of the abantian throng,
  seized to despoil, and dragg'd the corpse along
  but while he strove to tug the inserted dart,
  agenor's javelin reach'd the hero's heart.
  his flank, unguarded by his ample shield,
  admits the lance  he falls, and spurns the field
  the nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more
  the soul comes floating in a tide of gore.
  trojans and greeks now gather round the slain
  the war renews, the warriors bleed again
  as o'er their prey rapacious wolves engage,
  man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.
  in blooming youth fair simoisius fell,
  sent by great ajax to the shades of hell
  fair simoisius, whom his mother bore
  amid the flocks on silver simois' shore
  the nymph descending from the hills of ide,
  to seek her parents on his flowery side,
  brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,
  and thence from simois named the lovely boy.
  short was his date! by dreadful ajax slain,
  he falls, and renders all their cares in vain!
  so falls a poplar, that in watery ground
  raised high the head, with stately branches crown'd,
   fell'd by some artist with his shining steel,
  to shape the circle of the bending wheel,
  cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,
  with all its beauteous honours on its head
  there, left a subject to the wind and rain,
  and scorch'd by suns, it withers on the plain
  thus pierced by ajax, simoisius lies
  stretch'd on the shore, and thus neglected dies.
  at ajax, antiphus his javelin threw
  the pointed lance with erring fury flew,
  and leucus, loved by wise ulysses, slew.
  he drops the corpse of simoisius slain,
  and sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.
  this saw ulysses, and with grief enraged,
  strode where the foremost of the foes engaged
  arm'd with his spear, he meditates the wound,
  in act to throw  but cautious look'd around,
  struck at his sight the trojans backward drew,
  and trembling heard the javelin as it flew.
  a chief stood nigh, who from abydos came,
  old priam's son, democoon was his name.
  the weapon entered close above his ear,
  cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear
  with piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,
  his eye-balls darken with the shades of death
  ponderous he falls  his clanging arms resound,
  and his broad buckler rings against the ground.
  seized with affright the boldest foes appear
  e'en godlike hector seems himself to fear
  slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled
  the greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead
  but phoebus now from ilion's towering height
  shines forth reveal'd, and animates the fight.
   trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose
  your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!
  nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb'd with steel
  your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.
  have ye forgot what seem'd your dread before?
  the great, the fierce achilles fights no more.
  apollo thus from ilion's lofty towers,
  array'd in terrors, roused the trojan powers
  while war's fierce goddess fires the grecian foe,
  and shouts and thunders in the fields below.
  then great diores fell, by doom divine,
  in vain his valour and illustrious line.
  a broken rock the force of pyrus threw,
   who from cold  nus led the thracian crew,
  full on his ankle dropp'd the ponderous stone,
  burst the strong nerves, and crash'd the solid bone.
  supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,
  before his helpless friends, and native bands,
  and spreads for aid his unavailing hands.
  the foe rush'd furious as he pants for breath,
  and through his navel drove the pointed death
  his gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,
  and the warm life came issuing from the wound.
  his lance bold thoas at the conqueror sent,
  deep in his breast above the pap it went,
  amid the lungs was fix'd the winged wood,
  and quivering in his heaving bosom stood
  till from the dying chief, approaching near,
  the  tolian warrior tugg'd his weighty spear
  then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,
  and gash'd his belly with a ghastly wound
  the corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,
  to spoil his arms the victor strove in vain
  the thracian bands against the victor press'd,
  a grove of lances glitter'd at his breast.
  stern thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,
  in sullen fury slowly quits the prize.
  thus fell two heroes  one the pride of thrace,
  and one the leader of the epeian race
  death's sable shade at once o'ercast their eyes,
  in dust the vanquish'd and the victor lies.
  with copious slaughter all the fields are red,
  and heap'd with growing mountains of the dead.
  had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,
  by pallas guarded through the dreadful field
  might darts be bid to turn their points away,
  and swords around him innocently play
  the war's whole art with wonder had he seen,
  and counted heroes where he counted men.
  so fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,
  and crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.
  but pallas now tydides' soul inspires,
  fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,
  above the greeks his deathless fame to raise,
  and crown her hero with distinguish'd praise.
  high on his helm celestial lightnings play,
  his beamy shield emits a living ray
  the unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,
  like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,
  when fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,
  and, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.
  such glories pallas on the chief bestow'd,
  such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd
  onward she drives him, furious to engage,
  where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.
  the sons of dares first the combat sought,
  a wealthy priest, but rich without a fault
  in vulcan's fane the father's days were led,
  the sons to toils of glorious battle bred
  these singled from their troops the fight maintain,
  these, from their steeds, tydides on the plain.
  fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,
  and first bold phegeus cast his sounding spear,
  which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,
  and spent in empty air its erring force.
  not so, tydides, flew thy lance in vain,
  but pierced his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.
  seized with unusual fear, idaeus fled,
  left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.
  and had not vulcan lent celestial aid,
  he too had sunk to death's eternal shade
  but in a smoky cloud the god of fire
  preserved the son, in pity to the sire.
  the steeds and chariot, to the navy led,
  increased the spoils of gallant diomed.
  struck with amaze and shame, the trojan crew,
  or slain, or fled, the sons of dares view
  when by the blood-stain'd hand minerva press'd
  the god of battles, and this speech address'd
   stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,
  who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!
  let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide
  and whose the conquest, mighty jove decide
  while we from interdicted fields retire,
  nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire.
  her words allay the impetuous warrior's heat,
  the god of arms and martial maid retreat
  removed from fight, on xanthus' flowery bounds
  they sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.
  meantime, the greeks the trojan race pursue,
  and some bold chieftain every leader slew
  first odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,
  his death ennobled by atrides' hand
  as he to flight his wheeling car address'd,
  the speedy javelin drove from back to breast.
  in dust the mighty halizonian lay,
  his arms resound, the spirit wings its way.
  thy fate was next, o phaestus! doom'd to feel
  the great idomeneus' protended steel
  whom borus sent  his son and only joy
  from fruitful tarne to the fields of troy.
  the cretan javelin reach'd him from afar,
  and pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car
  back from the car he tumbles to the ground,
  and everlasting shades his eyes surround.
  then died scamandrius, expert in the chase,
  in woods and wilds to wound the savage race
  diana taught him all her sylvan arts,
  to bend the bow, and aim unerring darts
  but vainly here diana's arts he tries,
  the fatal lance arrests him as he flies
  from menelaus' arm the weapon sent,
  through his broad back and heaving bosom went
  down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,
  his brazen armour rings against the ground.
  next artful phereclus untimely fell
  bold merion sent him to the realms of hell.
  thy father's skill, o phereclus! was thine,
  the graceful fabric and the fair design
  for loved by pallas, pallas did impart
  to him the shipwright's and the builder's art.
  beneath his hand the fleet of paris rose,
  the fatal cause of all his country's woes
  but he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,
  nor saw his country's peril, nor his own.
  the hapless artist, while confused he fled,
  the spear of merion mingled with the dead.
  through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,
  between the bladder and the bone it pass'd
  prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,
  and death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.
  from meges' force the swift pedaeus fled,
  antenor's offspring from a foreign bed,
  whose generous spouse, theanor, heavenly fair,
  nursed the young stranger with a mother's care.
  how vain those cares! when meges in the rear
  full in his nape infix'd the fatal spear
  swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,
  and the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.
  then died hypsenor, generous and divine,
  sprung from the brave dolopion's mighty line,
  who near adored scamander made abode,
  priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.
  on him, amidst the flying numbers found,
  eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound
  on his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,
  thence glancing downwards, lopp'd his holy hand,
  which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.
  down sunk the priest  the purple hand of death
  closed his dim eye, and fate suppress'd his breath.
  thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engaged.
  in every quarter fierce tydides raged
  amid the greek, amid the trojan train,
  rapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain
  now here, now there, he darts from place to place,
  pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.
  thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong
  deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,
  through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds,
  o'erwhelm's the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds
  the yellow harvests of the ripen'd year,
  and flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!
  while jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,
  and all the labours of mankind are vain.
  so raged tydides, boundless in his ire,
  drove armies back, and made all troy retire.
  with grief the leader of the lycian band
  saw the wide waste of his destructive hand
  his bended bow against the chief he drew
  swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,
  whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,
  deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore
  the rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,
  while the proud archer thus exulting cried
   hither, ye trojans, hither drive your steeds!
  lo! by our hand the bravest grecian bleeds,
  not long the deathful dart he can sustain
  or phoebus urged me to these fields in vain.
  so spoke he, boastful  but the winged dart
  stopp'd short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art.
  the wounded chief, behind his car retired,
  the helping hand of sthenelus required
  swift from his seat he leap'd upon the ground,
  and tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound
  when thus the king his guardian power address'd,
  the purple current wandering o'er his vest
   o progeny of jove! unconquer'd maid!
  if e'er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,
  if e'er i felt thee in the fighting field
  now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.
  o give my lance to reach the trojan knight,
  whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard'st in fight
  and lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,
  that vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.
  thus pray'd tydides, and minerva heard,
  his nerves confirm'd, his languid spirits cheer'd
  he feels each limb with wonted vigour light
  his beating bosom claim'd the promised fight.
   be bold,  she cried , in every combat shine,
  war be thy province, thy protection mine
  rush to the fight, and every foe control
  wake each paternal virtue in thy soul
  strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,
  and all thy godlike father breathes in thee
  yet more, from mortal mists i purge thy eyes,
  and set to view the warring deities.
  these see thou shun, through all the embattled plain
  nor rashly strive where human force is vain.
  if venus mingle in the martial band,
  her shalt thou wound  so pallas gives command.
  with that, the blue-eyed virgin wing'd her flight
  the hero rush'd impetuous to the fight
  with tenfold ardour now invades the plain,
  wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.
  as on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,
  amidst the field a brindled lion falls
  if chance some shepherd with a distant dart
  the savage wound, he rouses at the smart,
  he foams, he roars  the shepherd dares not stay,
  but trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey
  heaps fall on heaps  he bathes with blood the ground,
  then leaps victorious o'er the lofty mound.
  not with less fury stern tydides flew
  and two brave leaders at an instant slew
  astynous breathless fell, and by his side,
  his people's pastor, good hypenor, died
  astynous' breast the deadly lance receives,
  hypenor's shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.
  those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage
  abas and polyidus to engage
  sons of eurydamus, who, wise and old,
  could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold
  the youths return'd not from the doubtful plain,
  and the sad father tried his arts in vain
  no mystic dream could make their fates appear,
  though now determined by tydides' spear.
  young xanthus next, and thoon felt his rage
  the joy and hope of phaenops' feeble age
  vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs
  of all his labours and a life of cares.
  cold death o'ertakes them in their blooming years,
  and leaves the father unavailing tears
  to strangers now descends his heapy store,
  the race forgotten, and the name no more.
  two sons of priam in one chariot ride,
  glittering in arms, and combat side by side.
  as when the lordly lion seeks his food
  where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,
  he leaps amidst them with a furious bound,
  bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground
  so from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,
  their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.
  with deep concern divine  neas view'd
  the foe prevailing, and his friends pursued
  through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,
  exploring pandarus with careful eyes.
  at length he found lycaon's mighty son
  to whom the chief of venus' race begun
   where, pandarus, are all thy honours now,
  thy winged arrows and unerring bow,
  thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall'd fame,
  and boasted glory of the lycian name?
  o pierce that mortal! if we mortal call
  that wondrous force by which whole armies fall
  or god incensed, who quits the distant skies
  to punish troy for slighted sacrifice
   which, oh avert from our unhappy state!
  for what so dreadful as celestial hate ?
  whoe'er he be, propitiate jove with prayer
  if man, destroy  if god, entreat to spare.
  to him the lycian   whom your eyes behold,
  if right i judge, is diomed the bold
  such coursers whirl him o'er the dusty field,
  so towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.
  if 'tis a god, he wears that chief's disguise
  or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,
  involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,
  and turns unseen the frustrate dart away.
  i wing'd an arrow, which not idly fell,
  the stroke had fix'd him to the gates of hell
  and, but some god, some angry god withstands,
  his fate was due to these unerring hands.
  skill'd in the bow, on foot i sought the war,
  nor join'd swift horses to the rapid car.
  ten polish'd chariots i possess'd at home,
  and still they grace lycaon's princely dome
  there veil'd in spacious coverlets they stand
  and twice ten coursers wait their lord's command.
  the good old warrior bade me trust to these,
  when first for troy i sail'd the sacred seas
  in fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,
  and through the ranks of death triumphant ride.
  but vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,
  i heard his counsels with unheedful mind,
  and thought the steeds  your large supplies unknown
  might fail of forage in the straiten'd town
  so took my bow and pointed darts in hand
  and left the chariots in my native land.
   too late, o friend! my rashness i deplore
  these shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.
  tydeus' and atreus' sons their points have found,
  and undissembled gore pursued the wound.
  in vain they bleed  this unavailing bow
  serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.
  in evil hour these bended horns i strung,
  and seized the quiver where it idly hung.
  cursed be the fate that sent me to the field
  without a warrior's arms, the spear and shield!
  if e'er with life i quit the trojan plain,
  if e'er i see my spouse and sire again,
  this bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,
  broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.
  to whom the leader of the dardan race
   be calm, nor phoebus' honour'd gift disgrace.
  the distant dart be praised, though here we need
  the rushing chariot and the bounding steed.
  against yon hero let us bend our course,
  and, hand to hand, encounter force with force.
  now mount my seat, and from the chariot's height
  observe my father's steeds, renown'd in fight
  practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,
  to dare the shock, or urge the rapid race
  secure with these, through fighting fields we go
  or safe to troy, if jove assist the foe.
  haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein
  the warrior's fury let this arm sustain
  or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,
  take thou the spear, the chariot's care be mine.
   o prince!  lycaon's valiant son replied
  as thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.
  the horses, practised to their lord's command,
  shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand
  but, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,
  thy voice alone can animate their flight
  else shall our fates be number'd with the dead,
  and these, the victor's prize, in triumph led.
  thine be the guidance, then  with spear and shield
  myself will charge this terror of the field.
  and now both heroes mount the glittering car
  the bounding coursers rush amidst the war
  their fierce approach bold sthenelus espied,
  who thus, alarm'd, to great tydides cried
   o friend! two chiefs of force immense i see,
  dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee
  lo the brave heir of old lycaon's line,
  and great  neas, sprung from race divine!
  enough is given to fame. ascend thy car!
  and save a life, the bulwark of our war.
  at this the hero cast a gloomy look,
  fix'd on the chief with scorn  and thus he spoke
   me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?
  me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?
  know, 'tis not honest in my soul to fear,
  nor was tydides born to tremble here.
  i hate the cumbrous chariot's slow advance,
  and the long distance of the flying lance
  but while my nerves are strong, my force entire,
  thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.
  nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey
  those threatening heroes, bear them both away
  one chief at least beneath this arm shall die
  so pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.
  but if she dooms, and if no god withstand,
  that both shall fall by one victorious hand,
  then heed my words  my horses here detain,
  fix'd to the chariot by the straiten'd rein
  swift to  neas' empty seat proceed,
  and seize the coursers of ethereal breed
  the race of those, which once the thundering god
  for ravish'd ganymede on tros bestow'd,
  the best that e'er on earth's broad surface run,
  beneath the rising or the setting sun.
  hence great anchises stole a breed unknown,
  by mortal mares, from fierce laomedon
  four of this race his ample stalls contain,
  and two transport  neas o'er the plain.
  these, were the rich immortal prize our own,
  through the wide world should make our glory known.
  thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,
  and stern lycaon's warlike race begun
   prince, thou art met. though late in vain assail'd,
  the spear may enter where the arrow fail'd.
  he said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung
  on his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,
  pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,
   he bleeds! the pride of greece!  the boaster cries,
  our triumph now, the mighty warrior lies!
   mistaken vaunter!  diomed replied
  thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried
  ye 'scape not both  one, headlong from his car,
  with hostile blood shall glut the god of war.
  he spoke, and rising hurl'd his forceful dart,
  which, driven by pallas, pierced a vital part
  full in his face it enter'd, and betwixt
  the nose and eye-ball the proud lycian fix'd
  crash'd all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,
  till the bright point look'd out beneath the chin.
  headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground
  earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound
  the starting coursers tremble with affright
  the soul indignant seeks the realms of night.
  to guard his slaughter'd friend,  neas flies,
  his spear extending where the carcase lies
  watchful he wheels, protects it every way,
  as the grim lion stalks around his prey.
  o'er the fall'n trunk his ample shield display'd,
  he hides the hero with his mighty shade,
  and threats aloud! the greeks with longing eyes
  behold at distance, but forbear the prize.
  then fierce tydides stoops  and from the fields
  heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.
  not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
  such men as live in these degenerate days
  he swung it round  and, gathering strength to throw,
  discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.
  where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,
  full on the bone the pointed marble lights
  through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,
  and stripp'd the skin, and crack'd the solid bone.
  sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,
  his falling bulk his bended arm sustains
  lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies
  a sudden cloud comes swimming o'er his eyes.
  there the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway'd,
  oppress'd had sunk to death's eternal shade,
  but heavenly venus, mindful of the love
  she bore anchises in the idaean grove,
  his danger views with anguish and despair,
  and guards her offspring with a mother's care.
  about her much-loved son her arms she throws,
  her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.
  screen'd from the foe behind her shining veil,
  the swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail
  safe through the rushing horse, and feather'd flight
  of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.
  nor sthenelus, with unassisting hands,
  remain'd unheedful of his lord's commands
  his panting steeds, removed from out the war,
  he fix'd with straiten'd traces to the car,
  next, rushing to the dardan spoil, detains
  the heavenly coursers with the flowing manes
  these in proud triumph to the fleet convey'd,
  no longer now a trojan lord obey'd.
  that charge to bold deipylus he gave,
   whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,
  then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,
  and follow'd where tydides swept the plain.
  meanwhile  his conquest ravished from his eyes
  the raging chief in chase of venus flies
  no goddess she, commission'd to the field,
  like pallas dreadful with her sable shield,
  or fierce bellona thundering at the wall,
  while flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall
  he knew soft combats suit the tender dame,
  new to the field, and still a foe to fame.
  through breaking ranks his furious course he bends,
  and at the goddess his broad lance extends
  through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,
  the ambrosial veil which all the graces wove
  her snowy hand the razing steel profaned,
  and the transparent skin with crimson stain'd,
  from the clear vein a stream immortal flow'd,
  such stream as issues from a wounded god
  pure emanation! uncorrupted flood!
  unlike our gross, diseased, terrestrial blood
   for not the bread of man their life sustains,
  nor wine's inflaming juice supplies their veins
  with tender shrieks the goddess fill'd the place,
  and dropp'd her offspring from her weak embrace.
  him phoebus took  he casts a cloud around
  the fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.
  then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,
  the king insults the goddess as she flies
   ill with jove's daughter bloody fights agree,
  the field of combat is no scene for thee
  go, let thy own soft sex employ thy care,
  go, lull the coward, or delude the fair.
  taught by this stroke renounce the war's alarms,
  and learn to tremble at the name of arms.
  tydides thus. the goddess, seized with dread,
  confused, distracted, from the conflict fled.
  to aid her, swift the winged iris flew,
  wrapt in a mist above the warring crew.
  the queen of love with faded charms she found.
  pale was her cheek, and livid look'd the wound.
  to mars, who sat remote, they bent their way
  far, on the left, with clouds involved he lay
  beside him stood his lance, distain'd with gore,
  and, rein'd with gold, his foaming steeds before.
  low at his knee, she begg'd with streaming eyes
  her brother's car, to mount the distant skies,
  and show'd the wound by fierce tydides given,
  a mortal man, who dares encounter heaven.
  stern mars attentive hears the queen complain,
  and to her hand commits the golden rein
  she mounts the seat, oppress'd with silent woe,
  driven by the goddess of the painted bow.
  the lash resounds, the rapid chariot flies,
  and in a moment scales the lofty skies
  they stopp'd the car, and there the coursers stood,
  fed by fair iris with ambrosial food
  before her mother, love's bright queen appears,
  o'erwhelmed with anguish, and dissolved in tears
  she raised her in her arms, beheld her bleed,
  and ask'd what god had wrought this guilty deed?
  then she   this insult from no god i found,
  an impious mortal gave the daring wound!
  behold the deed of haughty diomed!
  'twas in the son's defence the mother bled.
  the war with troy no more the grecians wage
  but with the gods  the immortal gods  engage.
  dione then   thy wrongs with patience bear,
  and share those griefs inferior powers must share
  unnumber'd woes mankind from us sustain,
  and men with woes afflict the gods again.
  the mighty mars in mortal fetters bound,
  and lodged in brazen dungeons underground,
  full thirteen moons imprison'd roar'd in vain
  otus and ephialtes held the chain
  perhaps had perish'd had not hermes' care
  restored the groaning god to upper air.
  great juno's self has borne her weight of pain,
  the imperial partner of the heavenly reign
  amphitryon's son infix'd the deadly dart,
  and fill'd with anguish her immortal heart.
  e'en hell's grim king alcides' power confess'd,
  the shaft found entrance in his iron breast
  to jove's high palace for a cure he fled,
  pierced in his own dominions of the dead
  where paeon, sprinkling heavenly balm around,
  assuaged the glowing pangs, and closed the wound.
  rash, impious man! to stain the bless'd abodes,
  and drench his arrows in the blood of gods!
   but thou  though pallas urged thy frantic deed ,
  whose spear ill-fated makes a goddess bleed,
  know thou, whoe'er with heavenly power contends,
  short is his date, and soon his glory ends
  from fields of death when late he shall retire,
  no infant on his knees shall call him sire.
  strong as thou art, some god may yet be found,
  to stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground
  thy distant wife,  giale the fair,
  starting from sleep with a distracted air,
  shall rouse thy slaves, and her lost lord deplore,
  the brave, the great, the glorious now no more!
  this said, she wiped from venus' wounded palm
  the sacred ichor, and infused the balm.
  juno and pallas with a smile survey'd,
  and thus to jove began the blue-eyed maid
   permit thy daughter, gracious jove! to tell
  how this mischance the cyprian queen befell,
  as late she tried with passion to inflame
  the tender bosom of a grecian dame
  allured the fair, with moving thoughts of joy,
  to quit her country for some youth of troy
  the clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,
  razed her soft hand with this lamented wound.
  the sire of gods and men superior smiled,
  and, calling venus, thus address'd his child
   not these, o daughter are thy proper cares,
  thee milder arts befit, and softer wars
  sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms
  to mars and pallas leave the deeds of arms.
  thus they in heaven  while on the plain below
  the fierce tydides charged his dardan foe,
  flush'd with celestial blood pursued his way,
  and fearless dared the threatening god of day
  already in his hopes he saw him kill'd,
  though screen'd behind apollo's mighty shield.
  thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook
  his blazing buckler thrice apollo shook
  he tried the fourth  when, breaking from the cloud,
  a more than mortal voice was heard aloud.
   o son of tydeus, cease! be wise and see
  how vast the difference of the gods and thee
  distance immense! between the powers that shine
  above, eternal, deathless, and divine,
  and mortal man! a wretch of humble birth,
  a short-lived reptile in the dust of earth.
  so spoke the god who darts celestial fires
  he dreads his fury, and some steps retires.
  then phoebus bore the chief of venus' race
  to troy's high fane, and to his holy place
  latona there and phoebe heal'd the wound,
  with vigour arm'd him, and with glory crown'd.
  this done, the patron of the silver bow
  a phantom raised, the same in shape and show
  with great  neas  such the form he bore,
  and such in fight the radiant arms he wore.
  around the spectre bloody wars are waged,
  and greece and troy with clashing shields engaged.
  meantime on ilion's tower apollo stood,
  and calling mars, thus urged the raging god
   stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall
  who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,
  rise in thy wrath! to hell's abhorr'd abodes
  despatch yon greek, and vindicate the gods.
  first rosy venus felt his brutal rage
  me next he charged, and dares all heaven engage
  the wretch would brave high heaven's immortal sire,
  his triple thunder, and his bolts of fire.
  the god of battle issues on the plain,
  stirs all the ranks, and fires the trojan train
  in form like acamas, the thracian guide,
  enraged to troy's retiring chiefs he cried
   how long, ye sons of priam! will ye fly,
  and unrevenged see priam's people die?
  still unresisted shall the foe destroy,
  and stretch the slaughter to the gates of troy?
  lo, brave  neas sinks beneath his wound,
  not godlike hector more in arms renown'd
  haste all, and take the generous warrior's part.
  he said --new courage swell'd each hero's heart.
  sarpedon first his ardent soul express'd,
  and, turn'd to hector, these bold words address'd
   say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?
  where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,
  that propp'd alone by priam's race should stand
  troy's sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?
  now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,
  and the proud vaunt in just derision ends.
  remote they stand while alien troops engage,
  like trembling hounds before the lion's rage.
  far distant hence i held my wide command,
  where foaming xanthus laves the lycian land
  with ample wealth  the wish of mortals  bless'd,
  a beauteous wife, and infant at her breast
  with those i left whatever dear could be
  greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me
  yet first in fight my lycian bands i cheer,
  and long to meet this mighty man ye fear
  while hector idle stands, nor bids the brave
  their wives, their infants, and their altars save.
  haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten'd state,
  or one vast burst of all-involving fate
  full o'er your towers shall fall, and sweep away
  sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish'd prey.
  rouse all thy trojans, urge thy aids to fight
  these claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night
  with force incessant the brave greeks oppose
  such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes.
  stung to the heart the generous hector hears,
  but just reproof with decent silence bears.
  from his proud car the prince impetuous springs,
  on earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.
  two shining spears are brandish'd in his hands
  thus arm'd, he animates his drooping bands,
  revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,
  and wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
  they turn, they stand  the greeks their fury dare,
  condense their powers, and wait the growing war.
  as when, on ceres' sacred floor, the swain
  spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,
  and the light chaff, before the breezes borne,
  ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn
  the grey dust, rising with collected winds,
  drives o'er the barn, and whitens all the hinds
  so white with dust the grecian host appears.
  from trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers
  the dusky clouds from labour'd earth arise,
  and roll in smoking volumes to the skies.
  mars hovers o'er them with his sable shield,
  and adds new horrors to the darken'd field
  pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,
  in troy's defence, apollo's heavenly will
  soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires,
  each trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.
  and now the god, from forth his sacred fane,
  produced  neas to the shouting train
  alive, unharm'd, with all his peers around,
  erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound
  inquiries none they made  the dreadful day
  no pause of words admits, no dull delay
  fierce discord storms, apollo loud exclaims,
  fame calls, mars thunders, and the field's in flames.
  stern diomed with either ajax stood,
  and great ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.
  embodied close, the labouring grecian train
  the fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.
  unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait
  serenely dreadful, and as fix'd as fate.
  so when the embattled clouds in dark array,
  along the skies their gloomy lines display
  when now the north his boisterous rage has spent,
  and peaceful sleeps the liquid element
  the low-hung vapours, motionless and still,
  rest on the summits of the shaded hill
  till the mass scatters as the winds arise,
  dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.
  nor was the general wanting to his train
  from troop to troop he toils through all the plain,
   ye greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear
  your brave associates and yourselves revere!
  let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,
  and catch from breast to breast the noble fire!
  on valour's side the odds of combat lie,
  the brave live glorious, or lamented die
  the wretch who trembles in the field of fame,
  meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!
  these words he seconds with his flying lance,
  to meet whose point was strong deicoon's chance
   neas' friend, and in his native place
  honour'd and loved like priam's royal race
  long had he fought the foremost in the field,
  but now the monarch's lance transpierced his shield
  his shield too weak the furious dart to stay,
  through his broad belt the weapon forced its way
  the grisly wound dismiss'd his soul to hell,
  his arms around him rattled as he fell.
  then fierce  neas, brandishing his blade,
  in dust orsilochus and crethon laid,
  whose sire diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,
  in well-built pherae held his lofty seat
  sprung from alpheus' plenteous stream, that yields
  increase of harvests to the pylian fields.
  he got orsilochus, diocleus he,
  and these descended in the third degree.
  too early expert in the martial toil,
  in sable ships they left their native soil,
  to avenge atrides  now, untimely slain,
  they fell with glory on the phrygian plain.
  so two young mountain lions, nursed with blood
  in deep recesses of the gloomy wood,
  rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll'd
  depopulate the stalls and waste the fold
  till pierced at distance from their native den,
  o'erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.
  prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,
  like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.
  great menelaus views with pitying eyes,
  lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies
  mars urged him on  yet, ruthless in his hate,
  the god but urged him to provoke his fate.
  he thus advancing, nestor's valiant son
  shakes for his danger, and neglects his own
  struck with the thought, should helen's lord be slain,
  and all his country's glorious labours vain.
  already met, the threatening heroes stand
  the spears already tremble in their hand
  in rush'd antilochus, his aid to bring,
  and fall or conquer by the spartan king.
  these seen, the dardan backward turn'd his course,
  brave as he was, and shunn'd unequal force.
  the breathless bodies to the greeks they drew,
  then mix in combat, and their toils renew.
  first, pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,
  who sheathed in brass the paphlagonians led.
  atrides mark'd him where sublime he stood
  fix'd in his throat the javelin drank his blood.
  the faithful mydon, as he turn'd from fight
  his flying coursers, sunk to endless night
  a broken rock by nestor's son was thrown
  his bended arm received the falling stone
  from his numb'd hand the ivory-studded reins,
  dropp'd in the dust, are trail'd along the plains
  meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound
  he groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground
  deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there
  the head stood fix'd, the quivering legs in air,
  till trampled flat beneath the coursers' feet
  the youthful victor mounts his empty seat,
  and bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.
  great hector saw, and, raging at the view,
  pours on the greeks  the trojan troops pursue
  he fires his host with animating cries,
  and brings along the furies of the skies,
  mars, stern destroyer! and bellona dread,
  flame in the front, and thunder at their head
  this swells the tumult and the rage of fight
  that shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.
  where hector march'd, the god of battles shined,
  now storm'd before him, and now raged behind.
  tydides paused amidst his full career
  then first the hero's manly breast knew fear.
  as when some simple swain his cot forsakes,
  and wide through fens an unknown journey takes
  if chance a swelling brook his passage stay,
  and foam impervious 'cross the wanderer's way,
  confused he stops, a length of country pass'd,
  eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.
  amazed no less the great tydides stands
  he stay'd, and turning thus address'd his bands
   no wonder, greeks! that all to hector yield
  secure of favouring gods, he takes the field
  his strokes they second, and avert our spears.
  behold where mars in mortal arms appears!
  retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow
  retire, but with your faces to the foe.
  trust not too much your unavailing might
  'tis not with troy, but with the gods ye fight.
  now near the greeks the black battalions drew
  and first two leaders valiant hector slew
  his force anchialus and mnesthes found,
  in every art of glorious war renown'd
  in the same car the chiefs to combat ride,
  and fought united, and united died.
  struck at the sight, the mighty ajax glows
  with thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.
  his massy spear with matchless fury sent,
  through amphius' belt and heaving belly went
  amphius apaesus' happy soil possess'd,
  with herds abounding, and with treasure bless'd
  but fate resistless from his country led
  the chief, to perish at his people's head.
  shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,
  and fierce, to seize it, conquering ajax sprung
  around his head an iron tempest rain'd
  a wood of spears his ample shield sustain'd
  beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press'd,
  and drew his javelin from the bleeding breast
  he could no more  the showering darts denied
  to spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.
  now foes on foes came pouring on the fields,
  with bristling lances, and compacted shields
  till in the steely circle straiten'd round,
  forced he gives way, and sternly quits the ground.
  while thus they strive, tlepolemus the great,
  urged by the force of unresisted fate,
  burns with desire sarpedon's strength to prove
  alcides' offspring meets the son of jove.
  sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.
  jove's great descendant, and his greater son.
  prepared for combat, ere the lance he toss'd,
  the daring rhodian vents his haughty boast
   what brings this lycian counsellor so far,
  to tremble at our arms, not mix in war!
  know thy vain self, nor let their flattery move,
  who style thee son of cloud-compelling jove.
  how far unlike those chiefs of race divine,
  how vast the difference of their deeds and thine!
  jove got such heroes as my sire, whose soul
  no fear could daunt, nor earth nor hell control.
  troy felt his arm, and yon proud ramparts stand
  raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand
  with six small ships, and but a slender train,
  he left the town a wide-deserted plain.
  but what art thou, who deedless look'st around,
  while unrevenged thy lycians bite the ground!
  small aid to troy thy feeble force can be
  but wert thou greater, thou must yield to me.
  pierced by my spear, to endless darkness go!
  i make this present to the shades below.
  the son of hercules, the rhodian guide,
  thus haughty spoke. the lycian king replied
   thy sire, o prince! o'erturn'd the trojan state,
  whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate
  those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far,
  false he detain'd, the just reward of war.
  nor so content, the generous chief defied,
  with base reproaches and unmanly pride.
  but you, unworthy the high race you boast,
  shall raise my glory when thy own is lost
  now meet thy fate, and by sarpedon slain,
  add one more ghost to pluto's gloomy reign.
  he said  both javelins at an instant flew
  both struck, both wounded, but sarpedon's slew
  full in the boaster's neck the weapon stood,
  transfix'd his throat, and drank the vital blood
  the soul disdainful seeks the caves of night,
  and his seal'd eyes for ever lose the light.
  yet not in vain, tlepolemus, was thrown
  thy angry lance  which piercing to the bone
  sarpedon's thigh, had robb'd the chief of breath
  but jove was present, and forbade the death.
  borne from the conflict by his lycian throng,
  the wounded hero dragg'd the lance along.
   his friends, each busied in his several part,
  through haste, or danger, had not drawn the dart.
  the greeks with slain tlepolemus retired
  whose fall ulysses view'd, with fury fired
  doubtful if jove's great son he should pursue,
  or pour his vengeance on the lycian crew.
  but heaven and fate the first design withstand,
  nor this great death must grace ulysses' hand.
  minerva drives him on the lycian train
  alastor, cronius, halius, strew'd the plain,
  alcander, prytanis, noemon fell
  and numbers more his sword had sent to hell,
  but hector saw  and, furious at the sight,
  rush'd terrible amidst the ranks of fight.
  with joy sarpedon view'd the wish'd relief,
  and, faint, lamenting, thus implored the chief
   o suffer not the foe to bear away
  my helpless corpse, an unassisted prey
  if i, unbless'd, must see my son no more,
  my much-loved consort, and my native shore,
  yet let me die in ilion's sacred wall
  troy, in whose cause i fell, shall mourn my fall.
  he said, nor hector to the chief replies,
  but shakes his plume, and fierce to combat flies
  swift as a whirlwind, drives the scattering foes
  and dyes the ground with purple as he goes.
  beneath a beech, jove's consecrated shade,
  his mournful friends divine sarpedon laid
  brave pelagon, his favourite chief, was nigh,
  who wrench'd the javelin from his sinewy thigh.
  the fainting soul stood ready wing'd for flight,
  and o'er his eye-balls swam the shades of night
  but boreas rising fresh, with gentle breath,
  recall'd his spirit from the gates of death.
  the generous greeks recede with tardy pace,
  though mars and hector thunder in their face
  none turn their backs to mean ignoble flight,
  slow they retreat, and even retreating fight.
  who first, who last, by mars' and hector's hand,
  stretch'd in their blood, lay gasping on the sand?
  tenthras the great, orestes the renown'd
  for managed steeds, and trechus press'd the ground ,
  next oenomaus and oenops' offspring died
  oresbius last fell groaning at their side
  oresbius, in his painted mitre gay,
  in fat boeotia held his wealthy sway,
  where lakes surround low hyle's watery plain
  a prince and people studious of their gain.
  the carnage juno from the skies survey'd,
  and touch'd with grief bespoke the blue-eyed maid
   oh, sight accursed! shall faithless troy prevail,
  and shall our promise to our people fail?
  how vain the word to menelaus given
  by jove's great daughter and the queen of heaven,
  beneath his arms that priam's towers should fall,
  if warring gods for ever guard the wall!
  mars, red with slaughter, aids our hated foes
  haste, let us arm, and force with force oppose!
  she spoke  minerva burns to meet the war
  and now heaven's empress calls her blazing car.
  at her command rush forth the steeds divine
  rich with immortal gold their trappings shine.
  bright hebe waits  by hebe, ever young,
  the whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.
  on the bright axle turns the bidden wheel
  of sounding brass  the polished axle steel.
  eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame
  the circles gold, of uncorrupted frame,
  such as the heavens produce  and round the gold
  two brazen rings of work divine were roll'd.
  the bossy naves of sold silver shone
  braces of gold suspend the moving throne
  the car, behind, an arching figure bore
  the bending concave form'd an arch before.
  silver the beam, the extended yoke was gold,
  and golden reins the immortal coursers hold.
  herself, impatient, to the ready car,
  the coursers joins, and breathes revenge and war.
  pallas disrobes  her radiant veil untied,
  with flowers adorn'd, with art diversified,
   the laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove,
  flows on the pavement of the court of jove.
  now heaven's dread arms her mighty limbs invest,
  jove's cuirass blazes on her ample breast
  deck'd in sad triumph for the mournful field,
  o'er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield,
  dire, black, tremendous! round the margin roll'd,
  a fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold
  here all the terrors of grim war appear,
  here rages force, here tremble flight and fear,
  here storm'd contention, and here fury frown'd,
  and the dire orb portentous gorgon crown'd.
  the massy golden helm she next assumes,
  that dreadful nods with four o'ershading plumes
  so vast, the broad circumference contains
  a hundred armies on a hundred plains.
  the goddess thus the imperial car ascends
  shook by her arm the mighty javelin bends,
  ponderous and huge  that when her fury burns,
  proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.
  swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly,
  while the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky.
  heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,
  heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged hours
  commission'd in alternate watch they stand,
  the sun's bright portals and the skies command,
  involve in clouds the eternal gates of day,
  or the dark barrier roll with ease away.
  the sounding hinges ring on either side
  the gloomy volumes, pierced with light, divide.
  the chariot mounts, where deep in ambient skies,
  confused, olympus' hundred heads arise
  where far apart the thunderer fills his throne,
  o'er all the gods superior and alone.
  there with her snowy hand the queen restrains
  the fiery steeds, and thus to jove complains
   o sire! can no resentment touch thy soul?
  can mars rebel, and does no thunder roll?
  what lawless rage on yon forbidden plain,
  what rash destruction! and what heroes slain!
  venus, and phoebus with the dreadful bow,
  smile on the slaughter, and enjoy my woe.
  mad, furious power! whose unrelenting mind
  no god can govern, and no justice bind.
  say, mighty father! shall we scourge this pride,
  and drive from fight the impetuous homicide?
  to whom assenting, thus the thunderer said
   go! and the great minerva be thy aid.
  to tame the monster-god minerva knows,
  and oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes.
  he said  saturnia, ardent to obey,
  lash'd her white steeds along the aerial way
  swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls,
  between the expanded earth and starry poles
  far as a shepherd, from some point on high,
  o'er the wide main extends his boundless eye,
  through such a space of air, with thundering sound,
  at every leap the immortal coursers bound
  troy now they reach'd and touch'd those banks divine,
  where silver simois and scamander join
  there juno stopp'd, and  her fair steeds unloosed
  of air condensed a vapour circumfused
  for these, impregnate with celestial dew,
  on simois, brink ambrosial herbage grew.
  thence to relieve the fainting argive throng,
  smooth as the sailing doves they glide along.
  the best and bravest of the grecian band
   a warlike circle  round tydides stand.
  such was their look as lions bathed in blood,
  or foaming boars, the terror of the wood
  heaven's empress mingles with the mortal crowd,
  and shouts, in stentor's sounding voice, aloud
  stentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,
  whose throats surpass'd the force of fifty tongues.
   inglorious argives! to your race a shame,
  and only men in figure and in name!
  once from the walls your timorous foes engaged,
  while fierce in war divine achilles raged
  now issuing fearless they possess the plain,
  now win the shores, and scarce the seas remain.
  her speech new fury to their hearts convey'd
  while near tydides stood the athenian maid
  the king beside his panting steeds she found,
  o'erspent with toil reposing on the ground
  to cool his glowing wound he sat apart,
   the wound inflicted by the lycian dart.
  large drops of sweat from all his limbs descend,
  beneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend,
  whose ample belt, that o'er his shoulder lay,
  he eased  and wash'd the clotted gore away.
  the goddess leaning o'er the bending yoke,
  beside his coursers, thus her silence broke
   degenerate prince! and not of tydeus' kind,
  whose little body lodged a mighty mind
  foremost he press'd in glorious toils to share,
  and scarce refrain'd when i forbade the war.
  alone, unguarded, once he dared to go,
  and feast, incircled by the theban foe
  there braved, and vanquish'd, many a hardy knight
  such nerves i gave him, and such force in fight.
  thou too no less hast been my constant care
  thy hands i arm'd, and sent thee forth to war
  but thee or fear deters, or sloth detains
  no drop of all thy father warms thy veins.
  the chief thus answered mild   immortal maid!
  i own thy presence, and confess thy aid.
  not fear, thou know'st, withholds me from the plains,
  nor sloth hath seized me, but thy word restrains
  from warring gods thou bad'st me turn my spear,
  and venus only found resistance here.
  hence, goddess! heedful of thy high commands,
  loth i gave way, and warn'd our argive bands
  for mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,
  with slaughter red, and raging round the field.
  then thus minerva -- brave tydides, hear!
  not mars himself, nor aught immortal, fear.
  full on the god impel thy foaming horse
  pallas commands, and pallas lends thee force.
  rash, furious, blind, from these to those he flies,
  and every side of wavering combat tries
  large promise makes, and breaks the promise made
  now gives the grecians, now the trojans aid.
  she said, and to the steeds approaching near,
  drew from his seat the martial charioteer.
  the vigorous power the trembling car ascends,
  fierce for revenge  and diomed attends
  the groaning axle bent beneath the load
  so great a hero, and so great a god.
  she snatch'd the reins, she lash'd with all her force,
  and full on mars impelled the foaming horse
  but first, to hide her heavenly visage, spread
  black orcus' helmet o'er her radiant head.
  just then gigantic periphas lay slain,
  the strongest warrior of the  tolian train
  the god, who slew him, leaves his prostrate prize
  stretch'd where he fell, and at tydides flies.
  now rushing fierce, in equal arms appear
  the daring greek, the dreadful god of war!
  full at the chief, above his courser's head,
  from mars's arm the enormous weapon fled
  pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance
  far from the car the strong immortal lance.
  then threw the force of tydeus' warlike son
  the javelin hiss'd  the goddess urged it on
  where the broad cincture girt his armour round,
  it pierced the god  his groin received the wound.
  from the rent skin the warrior tugs again
  the smoking steel. mars bellows with the pain
  loud as the roar encountering armies yield,
  when shouting millions shake the thundering field.
  both armies start, and trembling gaze around
  and earth and heaven re-bellow to the sound.
  as vapours blown by auster's sultry breath,
  pregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,
  beneath the rage of burning sirius rise,
  choke the parch'd earth, and blacken all the skies
  in such a cloud the god from combat driven,
  high o'er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.
  wild with his pain, he sought the bright abodes,
  there sullen sat beneath the sire of gods,
  show'd the celestial blood, and with a groan
  thus pour'd his plaints before the immortal throne
   can jove, supine, flagitious facts survey,
  and brook the furies of this daring day?
  for mortal men celestial powers engage,
  and gods on gods exert eternal rage
  from thee, o father! all these ills we bear,
  and thy fell daughter with the shield and spear
  thou gavest that fury to the realms of light,
  pernicious, wild, regardless of the right.
  all heaven beside reveres thy sovereign sway,
  thy voice we hear, and thy behests obey
  'tis hers to offend, and even offending share
  thy breast, thy counsels, thy distinguish'd care
  so boundless she, and thou so partial grown,
  well may we deem the wondrous birth thy own.
  now frantic diomed, at her command,
  against the immortals lifts his raging hand
  the heavenly venus first his fury found,
  me next encountering, me he dared to wound
  vanquish'd i fled  even i, the god of fight,
  from mortal madness scarce was saved by flight.
  else hadst thou seen me sink on yonder plain,
  heap'd round, and heaving under loads of slain!
  or pierced with grecian darts, for ages lie,
  condemn'd to pain, though fated not to die.
  him thus upbraiding, with a wrathful look
  the lord of thunders view'd, and stern bespoke
   to me, perfidious! this lamenting strain?
  of lawless force shall lawless mars complain?
  of all the gods who tread the spangled skies,
  thou most unjust, most odious in our eyes!
  inhuman discord is thy dire delight,
  the waste of slaughter, and the rage of fight.
  no bounds, no law, thy fiery temper quells,
  and all thy mother in thy soul rebels.
  in vain our threats, in vain our power we use
  she gives the example, and her son pursues.
  yet long the inflicted pangs thou shall not mourn,
  sprung since thou art from jove, and heavenly-born.
  else, singed with lightning, hadst thou hence been thrown,
  where chain'd on burning rocks the titans groan.
  thus he who shakes olympus with his nod
  then gave to paeon's care the bleeding god.
  with gentle hand the balm he pour'd around,
  and heal'd the immortal flesh, and closed the wound.
  as when the fig's press'd juice, infused in cream,
  to curds coagulates the liquid stream,
  sudden the fluids fix the parts combined
  such, and so soon, the ethereal texture join'd.
  cleansed from the dust and gore, fair hebe dress'd
  his mighty limbs in an immortal vest.
  glorious he sat, in majesty restored,
  fast by the throne of heaven's superior lord.
  juno and pallas mount the bless'd abodes,
  their task perform'd, and mix among the gods.
  now heaven forsakes the fight  the immortals yield
  to human force and human skill the field
  dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes
  now here, now there, the tide of combat flows
  while troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain
  on either side, run purple to the main.
  great ajax first to conquest led the way,
  broke the thick ranks, and turn'd the doubtful day.
  the thracian acamas his falchion found,
  and hew'd the enormous giant to the ground
  his thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd
  where the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest
  fix'd in his front the brazen weapon lies,
  and seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.
  next teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,
  axylus, hospitable, rich, and good
  in fair arisbe's walls  his native place
  he held his seat! a friend to human race.
  fast by the road, his ever-open door
  obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.
  to stern tydides now he falls a prey,
  no friend to guard him in the dreadful day!
  breathless the good man fell, and by his side
  his faithful servant, old calesius died.
  by great euryalus was dresus slain,
  and next he laid opheltius on the plain.
  two twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,
  from a fair naiad and bucolion sprung
   laomedon's white flocks bucolion fed,
  that monarch's first-born by a foreign bed
  in secret woods he won the naiad's grace,
  and two fair infants crown'd his strong embrace
  here dead they lay in all their youthful charms
  the ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.
  astyalus by polypoetes fell
  ulysses' spear pidytes sent to hell
  by teucer's shaft brave aretaon bled,
  and nestor's son laid stern ablerus dead
  great agamemnon, leader of the brave,
  the mortal wound of rich elatus gave,
  who held in pedasus his proud abode,
  and till'd the banks where silver satnio flow'd.
  melanthius by eurypylus was slain
  and phylacus from leitus flies in vain.
  unbless'd adrastus next at mercy lies
  beneath the spartan spear, a living prize.
  scared with the din and tumult of the fight,
  his headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,
  rush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke
  the shatter'd chariot from the crooked yoke
  wide o'er the field, resistless as the wind,
  for troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.
  prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel
  atrides o'er him shakes his vengeful steel
  the fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd
  the victor's knees, and thus his prayer address'd
   o spare my youth, and for the life i owe
  large gifts of price my father shall bestow.
  when fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,
  thy hollow ships his captive son detain
  rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,
  and steel well-temper'd, and persuasive gold.
  he said  compassion touch'd the hero's heart
  he stood, suspended with the lifted dart
  as pity pleaded for his vanquish'd prize,
  stern agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,
  and, furious, thus   oh impotent of mind!
  shall these, shall these atrides' mercy find?
  well hast thou known proud troy's perfidious land,
  and well her natives merit at thy hand!
  not one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,
  shall save a trojan from our boundless rage
  ilion shall perish whole, and bury all
  her babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall
  a dreadful lesson of exampled fate,
  to warn the nations, and to curb the great!
  the monarch spoke  the words, with warmth address'd,
  to rigid justice steel'd his brother's breast
  fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust
  the monarch's javelin stretch'd him in the dust,
  then pressing with his foot his panting heart,
  forth from the slain he tugg'd the reeking dart.
  old nestor saw, and roused the warrior's rage
   thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage
  no son of mars descend, for servile gains,
  to touch the booty, while a foe remains.
  behold yon glittering host, your future spoil!
  first gain the conquest, then reward the toil.
  and now had greece eternal fame acquired,
  and frighted troy within her walls, retired,
  had not sage helenus her state redress'd,
  taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.
  where hector stood, with great  neas join'd,
  the seer reveal'd the counsels of his mind
   ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay
  the cares and glories of this doubtful day
  on whom your aids, your country's hopes depend
  wise to consult, and active to defend!
  here, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,
  turn back the routed, and forbid the flight,
  ere yet their wives' soft arms the cowards gain,
  the sport and insult of the hostile train.
  when your commands have hearten'd every band,
  ourselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand
  press'd as we are, and sore of former fight,
  these straits demand our last remains of might.
  meanwhile thou, hector, to the town retire,
  and teach our mother what the gods require
  direct the queen to lead the assembled train
  of troy's chief matrons to minerva's fane
  unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,
  with offer'd vows, in ilion's topmost tower.
  the largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,
  most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,
  before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,
  and twelve young heifers to her altars led
  if so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,
  our wives, our infants, and our city spare,
  and far avert tydides' wasteful ire,
  that mows whole troops, and makes all troy retire
  not thus achilles taught our hosts to dread,
  sprung though he was from more than mortal bed
  not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,
  in rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might.
  hector obedient heard  and, with a bound,
  leap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground
  through all his host inspiring force he flies,
  and bids the thunder of the battle rise.
  with rage recruited the bold trojans glow,
  and turn the tide of conflict on the foe
  fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears
  all greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears
  some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,
  shot down avenging from the vault of stars.
  then thus aloud   ye dauntless dardans, hear!
  and you whom distant nations send to war!
  be mindful of the strength your fathers bore
  be still yourselves, and hector asks no more.
  one hour demands me in the trojan wall,
  to bid our altars flame, and victims fall
  nor shall, i trust, the matrons' holy train,
  and reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.
  this said, with ample strides the hero pass'd
  the shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,
  his neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung
  and as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.
  now paused the battle  godlike hector gone ,
  where daring glaucus and great tydeus' son
  between both armies met  the chiefs from far
  observed each other, and had mark'd for war.
  near as they drew, tydides thus began
   what art thou, boldest of the race of man?
  our eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,
  where fame is reap'd amid the embattled field
  yet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,
  and meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.
  unhappy they, and born of luckless sires,
  who tempt our fury when minerva fires!
  but if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,
  know with immortals we no more contend.
  not long lycurgus view'd the golden light,
  that daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.
  bacchus, and bacchus' votaries, he drove,
  with brandish'd steel, from nyssa's sacred grove
  their consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,
  with curling vines and twisted ivy bound
  while bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,
  and thetis' arms received the trembling god.
  nor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move
   the immortals bless'd with endless ease above
  deprived of sight by their avenging doom,
  cheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,
  then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,
  a wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!
  i brave not heaven  but if the fruits of earth
  sustain thy life, and human be thy birth,
  bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,
  approach, and enter the dark gates of death.
   what, or from whence i am, or who my sire,
   replied the chief,  can tydeus' son inquire?
  like leaves on trees the race of man is found,
  now green in youth, now withering on the ground
  another race the following spring supplies
  they fall successive, and successive rise
  so generations in their course decay
  so flourish these, when those are pass'd away.
  but if thou still persist to search my birth,
  then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.
   a city stands on argos' utmost bound,
   argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,
  aeolian sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,
  in ancient time the happy wall possess'd,
  then call'd ephyre  glaucus was his son
  great glaucus, father of bellerophon,
  who o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,
  loved for that valour which preserves mankind.
  then mighty praetus argos' sceptre sway'd,
  whose hard commands bellerophon obey'd.
  with direful jealousy the monarch raged,
  and the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.
  for him antaea burn'd with lawless flame,
  and strove to tempt him from the paths of fame
  in vain she tempted the relentless youth,
  endued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.
  fired at his scorn the queen to praetus fled,
  and begg'd revenge for her insulted bed
  incensed he heard, resolving on his fate
  but hospitable laws restrain'd his hate
  to lycia the devoted youth he sent,
  with tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.
  now bless'd by every power who guards the good,
  the chief arrived at xanthus' silver flood
  there lycia's monarch paid him honours due,
  nine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.
  but when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,
  the faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd
  the fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,
  the deathful secret to the king reveal'd.
  first, dire chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd
  a mingled monster of no mortal kind!
  behind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread
  a goat's rough body bore a lion's head
  her pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire
  her gaping throat emits infernal fire.
   this pest he slaughter'd,  for he read the skies,
  and trusted heaven's informing prodigies,
  then met in arms the solymaean crew,
   fiercest of men,  and those the warrior slew
  next the bold amazons' whole force defied
  and conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.
   nor ended here his toils  his lycian foes,
  at his return, a treacherous ambush rose,
  with levell'd spears along the winding shore
  there fell they breathless, and return'd no more.
   at length the monarch, with repentant grief,
  confess'd the gods, and god-descended chief
  his daughter gave, the stranger to detain,
  with half the honours of his ample reign
  the lycians grant a chosen space of ground,
  with woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.
  there long the chief his happy lot possess'd,
  with two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd
   fair e'en in heavenly eyes  her fruitful love
  crown'd with sarpedon's birth the embrace of jove
  but when at last, distracted in his mind,
  forsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,
  wide o'er the aleian field he chose to stray,
  a long, forlorn, uncomfortable way!
  woes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart
  his beauteous daughter fell by phoebe's dart
  his eldest born by raging mars was slain,
  in combat on the solymaean plain.
  hippolochus survived  from him i came,
  the honour'd author of my birth and name
  by his decree i sought the trojan town
  by his instructions learn to win renown,
  to stand the first in worth as in command,
  to add new honours to my native land,
  before my eyes my mighty sires to place,
  and emulate the glories of our race.
  he spoke, and transport fill'd tydides' heart
  in earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,
  then friendly, thus the lycian prince address'd
   welcome, my brave hereditary guest!
  thus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,
  nor stain the sacred friendship of our race.
  know, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old
  oeneus the strong, bellerophon the bold
  our ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,
  where twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.
  the parting heroes mutual presents left
  a golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift
  oeneus a belt of matchless work bestowed,
  that rich with tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.
   this from his pledge i learn'd, which, safely stored
  among my treasures, still adorns my board
  for tydeus left me young, when thebe's wall
  beheld the sons of greece untimely fall.
  mindful of this, in friendship let us join
  if heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,
  my guest in argos thou, and i in lycia thine.
  enough of trojans to this lance shall yield,
  in the full harvest of yon ample field
  enough of greeks shall dye thy spear with gore
  but thou and diomed be foes no more.
  now change we arms, and prove to either host
  we guard the friendship of the line we boast.
  thus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,
  their hands they join, their mutual faith they plight
  brave glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,
   jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,
  for diomed's brass arms, of mean device,
  for which nine oxen paid,  a vulgar price,
  he gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,
  a hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.
  meantime the guardian of the trojan state,
  great hector, enter'd at the scaean gate.
  beneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,
  the trojan matrons and the trojan maids
  around him flock'd, all press'd with pious care
  for husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.
  he bids the train in long procession go,
  and seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.
  and now to priam's stately courts he came,
  rais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame
  o'er these a range of marble structure runs,
  the rich pavilions of his fifty sons,
  in fifty chambers lodged  and rooms of state,
  opposed to those, where priam's daughters sate.
  twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,
  of equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.
  hither great hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen
  of royal hecuba, his mother-queen.
   with her laodice, whose beauteous face
  surpass'd the nymphs of troy's illustrious race.
  long in a strict embrace she held her son,
  and press'd his hand, and tender thus begun
   o hector! say, what great occasion calls
  my son from fight, when greece surrounds our walls
  com'st thou to supplicate the almighty power
  with lifted hands, from ilion's lofty tower?
  stay, till i bring the cup with bacchus crown'd,
  in jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,
  and pay due vows to all the gods around.
  then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,
  and draw new spirits from the generous bowl
  spent as thou art with long laborious fight,
  the brave defender of thy country's right.
   far hence be bacchus' gifts   the chief rejoin'd
  inflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,
  unnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.
  let chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice
  to sprinkle to the gods, its better use.
  by me that holy office were profaned
  ill fits it me, with human gore distain'd,
  to the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,
  or offer heaven's great sire polluted praise.
  you, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,
  and burn rich odours in minerva's fane.
  the largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,
  most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,
  before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,
  and twelve young heifers to her altar led.
  so may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,
  our wives, our infants, and our city spare
  and far avert tydides' wasteful ire,
  who mows whole troops, and makes all troy retire.
  be this, o mother, your religious care
  i go to rouse soft paris to the war
  if yet not lost to all the sense of shame,
  the recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.
  oh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,
  that pest of troy, that ruin of our race!
  deep to the dark abyss might he descend,
  troy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end.
  this heard, she gave command  and summon'd came
  each noble matron and illustrious dame.
  the phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,
  where treasured odours breathed a costly scent.
  there lay the vestures of no vulgar art,
  sidonian maids embroider'd every part,
  whom from soft sidon youthful paris bore,
  with helen touching on the tyrian shore.
  here, as the queen revolved with careful eyes
  the various textures and the various dyes,
  she chose a veil that shone superior far,
  and glow'd refulgent as the morning star.
  herself with this the long procession leads
  the train majestically slow proceeds.
  soon as to ilion's topmost tower they come,
  and awful reach the high palladian dome,
  antenor's consort, fair theano, waits
  as pallas' priestess, and unbars the gates.
  with hands uplifted and imploring eyes,
  they fill the dome with supplicating cries.
  the priestess then the shining veil displays,
  placed on minerva's knees, and thus she prays
   oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,
  troy's strong defence, unconquer'd pallas, aid!
  break thou tydides' spear, and let him fall
  prone on the dust before the trojan wall!
  so twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,
  shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.
  but thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,
  ourselves, our infants, and our city spare!
  so pray'd the priestess in her holy fane
  so vow'd the matrons, but they vow'd in vain.
  while these appear before the power with prayers,
  hector to paris' lofty dome repairs.
  himself the mansion raised, from every part
  assembling architects of matchless art.
  near priam's court and hector's palace stands
  the pompous structure, and the town commands.
  a spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,
  of full ten cubits was the lance's length,
  the steely point with golden ringlets join'd,
  before him brandish'd, at each motion shined
  thus entering, in the glittering rooms he found
  his brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,
  his eyes delighting with their splendid show,
  brightening the shield, and polishing the bow.
  beside him helen with her virgins stands,
  guides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.
  him thus inactive, with an ardent look
  the prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke.
   thy hate to troy, is this the time to show?
   o wretch ill-fated, and thy country's foe!
  paris and greece against us both conspire,
  thy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.
  for thee great ilion's guardian heroes fall,
  till heaps of dead alone defend her wall,
  for thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,
  and wasteful war in all its fury burns.
  ungrateful man! deserves not this thy care,
  our troops to hearten, and our toils to share?
  rise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,
  and all the phrygian glories at an end.
   brother, 'tis just,  replied the beauteous youth,
  thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth
  yet charge my absence less, o generous chief!
  on hate to troy, than conscious shame and grief
  here, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate,
  and mourn'd, in secret, his and ilion's fate.
  'tis now enough  now glory spreads her charms,
  and beauteous helen calls her chief to arms.
  conquest to-day my happier sword may bless,
  'tis man's to fight, but heaven's to give success.
  but while i arm, contain thy ardent mind
  or go, and paris shall not lag behind.
  he said, nor answer'd priam's warlike son
  when helen thus with lowly grace begun
   oh, generous brother!  if the guilty dame
  that caused these woes deserve a sister's name!
  would heaven, ere all these dreadful deeds were done,
  the day that show'd me to the golden sun
  had seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bear
  the fatal infant to the fowls of air?
  why sunk i not beneath the whelming tide,
  and midst the roarings of the waters died?
  heaven fill'd up all my ills, and i accursed
  bore all, and paris of those ills the worst.
  helen at least a braver spouse might claim,
  warm'd with some virtue, some regard of fame!
  now tired with toils, thy fainting limbs recline,
  with toils, sustain'd for paris' sake and mine
  the gods have link'd our miserable doom,
  our present woe, and infamy to come
  wide shall it spread, and last through ages long,
  example sad! and theme of future song.
  the chief replied   this time forbids to rest
  the trojan bands, by hostile fury press'd,
  demand their hector, and his arm require
  the combat urges, and my soul's on fire.
  urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls,
  and timely join me, ere i leave the walls.
  ere yet i mingle in the direful fray,
  my wife, my infant, claim a moment's stay
  this day  perhaps the last that sees me here
  demands a parting word, a tender tear
  this day, some god who hates our trojan land
  may vanquish hector by a grecian hand.
  he said, and pass'd with sad presaging heart
  to seek his spouse, his soul's far dearer part
  at home he sought her, but he sought in vain
  she, with one maid of all her menial train,
  had hence retired  and with her second joy,
  the young astyanax, the hope of troy,
  pensive she stood on ilion's towery height,
  beheld the war, and sicken'd at the sight
  there her sad eyes in vain her lord explore,
  or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore.
  but he who found not whom his soul desired,
  whose virtue charm'd him as her beauty fired,
  stood in the gates, and ask'd  what way she bent
  her parting step? if to the fane she went,
  where late the mourning matrons made resort
  or sought her sisters in the trojan court?
   not to the court,  replied the attendant train,
  nor mix'd with matrons to minerva's fane
  to ilion's steepy tower she bent her way,
  to mark the fortunes of the doubtful day.
  troy fled, she heard, before the grecian sword
  she heard, and trembled for her absent lord
  distracted with surprise, she seem'd to fly,
  fear on her cheek, and sorrow m her eye.
  the nurse attended with her infant boy,
  the young astyanax, the hope of troy.
  hector this heard, return'd without delay
  swift through the town he trod his former way,
  through streets of palaces, and walks of state
  and met the mourner at the scaean gate.
  with haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair.
  his blameless wife, aetion's wealthy heir
   cilician thebe great aetion sway'd,
  and hippoplacus' wide extended shade
  the nurse stood near, in whose embraces press'd,
  his only hope hung smiling at her breast,
  whom each soft charm and early grace adorn,
  fair as the new-born star that gilds the morn.
  to this loved infant hector gave the name
  scamandrius, from scamander's honour'd stream
  astyanax the trojans call'd the boy,
  from his great father, the defence of troy.
  silent the warrior smiled, and pleased resign'd
  to tender passions all his mighty mind
  his beauteous princess cast a mournful look,
  hung on his hand, and then dejected spoke
  her bosom laboured with a boding sigh,
  and the big tear stood trembling in her eye.
   too daring prince! ah, whither dost thou run?
  ah, too forgetful of thy wife and son!
  and think'st thou not how wretched we shall be,
  a widow i, a helpless orphan he?
  for sure such courage length of life denies,
  and thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.
  greece in her single heroes strove in vain
  now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain.
  o grant me, gods, ere hector meets his doom,
  all i can ask of heaven, an early tomb!
  so shall my days in one sad tenor run,
  and end with sorrows as they first begun.
  no parent now remains my griefs to share,
  no father's aid, no mother's tender care.
  the fierce achilles wrapt our walls in fire,
  laid thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!
  his fate compassion in the victor bred
  stern as he was, he yet revered the dead,
  his radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,
  and laid him decent on the funeral pile
  then raised a mountain where his bones were burn'd,
  the mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn'd,
  jove's sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow
  a barren shade, and in his honour grow.
   by the same arm my seven brave brothers fell
  in one sad day beheld the gates of hell
  while the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed,
  amid their fields the hapless heroes bled!
  my mother lived to wear the victor's bands,
  the queen of hippoplacia's sylvan lands
  redeem'd too late, she scarce beheld again
  her pleasing empire and her native plain,
  when ah! oppress'd by life-consuming woe,
  she fell a victim to diana's bow.
   yet while my hector still survives, i see
  my father, mother, brethren, all, in thee
  alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all
  once more will perish, if my hector fall,
  thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share
  oh, prove a husband's and a father's care!
  that quarter most the skilful greeks annoy,
  where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of troy
  thou, from this tower defend the important post
  there agamemnon points his dreadful host,
  that pass tydides, ajax, strive to gain,
  and there the vengeful spartan fires his train.
  thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,
  or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.
  let others in the field their arms employ,
  but stay my hector here, and guard his troy.
  the chief replied   that post shall be my care,
  not that alone, but all the works of war.
  how would the sons of troy, in arms renown'd,
  and troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground
  attaint the lustre of my former name,
  should hector basely quit the field of fame?
  my early youth was bred to martial pains,
  my soul impels me to the embattled plains!
  let me be foremost to defend the throne,
  and guard my father's glories, and my own.
   yet come it will, the day decreed by fates!
   how my heart trembles while my tongue relates!
  the day when thou, imperial troy! must bend,
  and see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.
  and yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,
  my mother's death, the ruin of my kind,
  not priam's hoary hairs defiled with gore,
  not all my brothers gasping on the shore
  as thine, andromache! thy griefs i dread
  i see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!
  in argive looms our battles to design,
  and woes, of which so large a part was thine!
  to bear the victor's hard commands, or bring
  the weight of waters from hyperia's spring.
  there while you groan beneath the load of life,
  they cry, 'behold the mighty hector's wife!'
  some haughty greek, who lives thy tears to see,
  imbitters all thy woes, by naming me.
  the thoughts of glory past, and present shame,
  a thousand griefs shall waken at the name!
  may i lie cold before that dreadful day,
  press'd with a load of monumental clay!
  thy hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,
  shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.
  thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of troy
  stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.
  the babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,
  scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.
  with secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,
  and hector hasted to relieve his child,
  the glittering terrors from his brows unbound,
  and placed the beaming helmet on the ground
  then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,
  thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer
   o thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,
  and all ye deathless powers! protect my son!
  grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,
  to guard the trojans, to defend the crown,
  against his country's foes the war to wage,
  and rise the hector of the future age!
  so when triumphant from successful toils
  of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,
  whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,
  and say, 'this chief transcends his father's fame '
  while pleased amidst the general shouts of troy,
  his mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy.
  he spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,
  restored the pleasing burden to her arms
  soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,
  hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.
  the troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,
  she mingled with a smile a tender tear.
  the soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,
  and dried the falling drops, and thus pursued
   andromache! my soul's far better part,
  why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?
  no hostile hand can antedate my doom,
  till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.
  fix'd is the term to all the race of earth
  and such the hard condition of our birth
  no force can then resist, no flight can save,
  all sink alike, the fearful and the brave.
  no more--but hasten to thy tasks at home,
  there guide the spindle, and direct the loom
  me glory summons to the martial scene,
  the field of combat is the sphere for men.
  where heroes war, the foremost place i claim,
  the first in danger as the first in fame.
  thus having said, the glorious chief resumes
  his towery helmet, black with shading plumes.
  his princess parts with a prophetic sigh,
  unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye
  that stream'd at every look  then, moving slow,
  sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.
  there, while her tears deplored the godlike man,
  through all her train the soft infection ran
  the pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,
  and mourn the living hector, as the dead.
  but now, no longer deaf to honour's call,
  forth issues paris from the palace wall.
  in brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,
  swift through the town the warrior bends his way.
  the wanton courser thus with reins unbound
  breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground
  pamper'd and proud, he seeks the wonted tides,
  and laves, in height of blood his shining sides
  his head now freed, he tosses to the skies
  his mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies
  he snuffs the females in the distant plain,
  and springs, exulting, to his fields again.
  with equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay,
  in arms refulgent as the god of day,
  the son of priam, glorying in his might,
  rush'd forth with hector to the fields of fight.
  and now, the warriors passing on the way,
  the graceful paris first excused his stay.
  to whom the noble hector thus replied
   o chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!
  thy power in war with justice none contest
  known is thy courage, and thy strength confess'd.
  what pity sloth should seize a soul so brave,
  or godlike paris live a woman's slave!
  my heart weeps blood at what the trojans say,
  and hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.
  haste then, in all their glorious labours share,
  for much they suffer, for thy sake, in war.
  these ills shall cease, whene'er by jove's decree
  we crown the bowl to heaven and liberty
  while the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns,
  and greece indignant through her seas returns.
  so spoke the guardian of the trojan state,
  then rush'd impetuous through the scaean gate.
  him paris follow'd to the dire alarms
  both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.
  as when to sailors labouring through the main,
  that long have heaved the weary oar in vain,
  jove bids at length the expected gales arise
  the gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.
  so welcome these to troy's desiring train,
  the bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.
  bold paris first the work of death begun
  on great menestheus, areithous' son,
  sprung from the fair philomeda's embrace,
  the pleasing arne was his native place.
  then sunk eioneus to the shades below,
  beneath his steely casque he felt the blow
  full on his neck, from hector's weighty hand
  and roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.
  by glaucus' spear the bold iphmous bleeds,
  fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds
  headlong he tumbles  his slack nerves unbound,
  drop the cold useless members on the ground.
  when now minerva saw her argives slain,
  from vast olympus to the gleaming plain
  fierce she descends  apollo marked her flight,
  nor shot less swift from ilion's towery height.
  radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade
  when thus apollo to the blue-eyed maid
   what cause, o daughter of almighty jove!
  thus wings thy progress from the realms above?
  once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,
  to give to greece the long divided day?
  too much has troy already felt thy hate,
  now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate
  this day, the business of the field suspend
  war soon shall kindle, and great ilion bend
  since vengeful goddesses confederate join
  to raze her walls, though built by hands divine.
  to whom the progeny of jove replies
   i left, for this, the council of the skies
  but who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,
  what art shall calm the furious sons of war?
  to her the god   great hector's soul incite
  to dare the boldest greek to single fight,
  till greece, provoked, from all her numbers show
  a warrior worthy to be hector's foe.
  at this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew
  sage helenus their secret counsels knew
  hector, inspired, he sought  to him address'd,
  thus told the dictates of his sacred breast
   o son of priam! let thy faithful ear
  receive my words  thy friend and brother hear!
  go forth persuasive, and a while engage
  the warring nations to suspend their rage
  then dare the boldest of the hostile train
  to mortal combat on the listed plain.
  for not this day shall end thy glorious date
  the gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.
  he said  the warrior heard the word with joy
  then with his spear restrain'd the youth of troy,
  held by the midst athwart. on either hand
  the squadrons part  the expecting trojans stand
  great agamemnon bids the greeks forbear
  they breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.
  the athenian maid, and glorious god of day,
  with silent joy the settling hosts survey
  in form of vultures, on the beech's height
  they sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.
  the thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,
  horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.
  as when a general darkness veils the main,
   soft zephyr curling the wide wat'ry plain,
  the waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,
  and a still horror saddens all the deeps
  thus in thick orders settling wide around,
  at length composed they sit, and shade the ground.
  great hector first amidst both armies broke
  the solemn silence, and their powers bespoke
   hear, all ye trojan, all ye grecian bands,
  what my soul prompts, and what some god commands.
  great jove, averse our warfare to compose,
  o'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes
  war with a fiercer tide once more returns,
  till ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.
  you then, o princes of the greeks! appear
  'tis hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear
  from all your troops select the boldest knight,
  and him, the boldest, hector dares to fight.
  here if i fall, by chance of battle slain,
  be his my spoil, and his these arms remain
  but let my body, to my friends return'd,
  by trojan hands and trojan flames be burn'd.
  and if apollo, in whose aid i trust,
  shall stretch your daring champion in the dust
  if mine the glory to despoil the foe
  on phoebus' temple i'll his arms bestow
  the breathless carcase to your navy sent,
  greece on the shore shall raise a monument
  which when some future mariner surveys,
  wash'd by broad hellespont's resounding seas,
  thus shall he say, 'a valiant greek lies there,
  by hector slain, the mighty man of war,'
  the stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name.
  and distant ages learn the victor's fame.
  this fierce defiance greece astonish'd heard,
  blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.
  stern menelaus first the silence broke,
  and, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke
   women of greece! o scandal of your race,
  whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,
  how great the shame, when every age shall know
  that not a grecian met this noble foe!
  go then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,
  a heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!
  be what ye seem, unanimated clay,
  myself will dare the danger of the day
  'tis man's bold task the generous strife to try,
  but in the hands of god is victory.
  these words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,
  his manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd.
  that day, atrides! a superior hand
  had stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand
  but all at once, thy fury to compose,
  the kings of greece, an awful band, arose
  even he their chief, great agamemnon, press'd
  thy daring hand, and this advice address'd
   whither, o menelaus! wouldst thou run,
  and tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?
  grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design
  great hectors arm is mightier far than thine
  even fierce achilles learn'd its force to fear,
  and trembling met this dreadful son of war.
  sit thou secure, amidst thy social band
  greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.
  the mightiest warrior of the achaian name,
  though bold and burning with desire of fame,
  content the doubtful honour might forego,
  so great the danger, and so brave the foe.
  he said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind
  he stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,
  no longer bent to rush on certain harms
  his joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.
  he from whose lips divine persuasion flows,
  grave nestor, then, in graceful act arose
  thus to the kings he spoke   what grief, what shame
  attend on greece, and all the grecian name!
  how shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn
  their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!
  what tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll'd,
  o peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!
  once with what joy the generous prince would hear
  of every chief who fought this glorious war,
  participate their fame, and pleased inquire
  each name, each action, and each hero's sire!
  gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,
  and trembling all before one hostile hand
  how would he lift his aged arms on high,
  lament inglorious greece, and beg to die!
  oh! would to all the immortal powers above,
  minerva, phoebus, and almighty jove!
  years might again roll back, my youth renew,
  and give this arm the spring which once it knew
  when fierce in war, where jardan's waters fall,
  i led my troops to phea's trembling wall,
  and with the arcadian spears my prowess tried,
  where celadon rolls down his rapid tide.
  there ereuthalion braved us in the field,
  proud areithous' dreadful arms to wield
  great areithous, known from shore to shore
  by the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore
  no lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,
  but broke, with this, the battle of the foe.
  him not by manly force lycurgus slew,
  whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,
  deep in a winding way his breast assailed,
  nor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd.
  supine he fell  those arms which mars before
  had given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore
  but when old age had dimm'd lycurgus' eyes,
  to ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.
  furious with this he crush'd our levell'd bands,
  and dared the trial of the strongest hands
  nor could the strongest hands his fury stay
  all saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway
  till i, the youngest of the host, appear'd,
  and, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.
  i fought the chief  my arms minerva crown'd
  prone fell the giant o'er a length of ground.
  what then i was, o were your nestor now!
  not hector's self should want an equal foe.
  but, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,
  the flower of greece, the examples of our host,
  sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,
  can you stand trembling, and desert the day?
  his warm reproofs the listening kings inflame
  and nine, the noblest of the grecian name,
  up-started fierce  but far before the rest
  the king of men advanced his dauntless breast
  then bold tydides, great in arms, appear'd
  and next his bulk gigantic ajax rear'd
  oileus follow'd  idomen was there,
  and merion, dreadful as the god of war
  with these eurypylus and thoas stand,
  and wise ulysses closed the daring band.
  all these, alike inspired with noble rage,
  demand the fight. to whom the pylian sage
   lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,
  what chief shall combat, let the gods decide.
  whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise
  his country's fame, his own immortal praise.
  the lots produced, each hero signs his own
  then in the general's helm the fates are thrown,
  the people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,
  and vows like these ascend from all the bands
   grant, thou almighty! in whose hand is fate,
  a worthy champion for the grecian state
  this task let ajax or tydides prove,
  or he, the king of kings, beloved by jove.
  old nestor shook the casque. by heaven inspired,
  leap'd forth the lot, of every greek desired.
  this from the right to left the herald bears,
  held out in order to the grecian peers
  each to his rival yields the mark unknown,
  till godlike ajax finds the lot his own
  surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,
  then casts before him, and with transport cries
   warriors! i claim the lot, and arm with joy
  be mine the conquest of this chief of troy.
  now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,
  to saturn's son be all your vows address'd
  but pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,
  and deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.
  said i in secret? no, your vows declare
  in such a voice as fills the earth and air,
  lives there a chief whom ajax ought to dread?
  ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!
  from warlike salamis i drew my birth,
  and, born to combats, fear no force on earth.
  he said. the troops with elevated eyes,
  implore the god whose thunder rends the skies
   o father of mankind, superior lord!
  on lofty ida's holy hill adored
  who in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,
  supreme of gods! unbounded and alone
  grant thou, that telamon may bear away
  the praise and conquest of this doubtful day
  or, if illustrious hector be thy care,
  that both may claim it, and that both may share.
  now ajax braced his dazzling armour on
  sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone
  he moves to combat with majestic pace
  so stalks in arms the grisly god of thrace,
  when jove to punish faithless men prepares,
  and gives whole nations to the waste of wars,
  thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god
  grimly he smiled  earth trembled as he strode
  his massy javelin quivering in his hand,
  he stood, the bulwark of the grecian band.
  through every argive heart new transport ran
  all troy stood trembling at the mighty man
  even hector paused  and with new doubt oppress'd,
  felt his great heart suspended in his breast
  'twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear
  himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.
  stern telamon behind his ample shield,
  as from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.
  huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,
  of tough bull-hides  of solid brass the last,
   the work of tychius, who in hyle dwell'd
  and in all arts of armoury excell'd,
  this ajax bore before his manly breast,
  and, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd
   hector! approach my arm, and singly know
  what strength thou hast, and what the grecian foe.
  achilles shuns the fight  yet some there are,
  not void of soul, and not unskill'd in war
  let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,
  indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more
  whole troops of heroes greece has yet to boast,
  and sends thee one, a sample of her host,
  such as i am, i come to prove thy might
  no more--be sudden, and begin the fight.
   o son of telamon, thy country's pride!
   to ajax thus the trojan prince replied
  me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,
  new to the field, and trembling at the fight?
  thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,
  to combat born, and bred amidst alarms
  i know to shift my ground, remount the car,
  turn, charge, and answer every call of war
  to right, to left, the dexterous lance i wield,
  and bear thick battle on my sounding shield
  but open be our fight, and bold each blow
  i steal no conquest from a noble foe.
  he said, and rising, high above the field
  whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.
  full on the brass descending from above
  through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,
  till in the seventh it fix'd. then ajax threw
  through hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,
  his corslet enters, and his garment rends,
  and glancing downwards, near his flank descends.
  the wary trojan shrinks, and bending low
  beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.
  from their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,
  then close impetuous, and the charge renew
  fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,
  or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.
  at ajax, hector his long lance extends
  the blunted point against the buckler bends
  but ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,
  drove through the trojan targe the knotty spear
  it reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!
  spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.
  yet ceased not hector thus  but stooping down,
  in his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,
  black, craggy, vast  to this his force he bends
  full on the brazen boss the stone descends
  the hollow brass resounded with the shock
  then ajax seized the fragment of a rock,
  applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,
  with force tempestuous, let the ruin fly
  the huge stone thundering through his buckler broke
  his slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke
  great hector falls extended on the field,
  his bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield
  nor wanted heavenly aid  apollo's might
  confirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.
  and now both heroes their broad falchions drew
  in flaming circles round their heads they flew
  but then by heralds' voice the word was given.
  the sacred ministers of earth and heaven
  divine talthybius, whom the greeks employ.
  and sage idaeus on the part of troy,
  between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd
  and first idaeus' awful voice was heard
   forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,
  both dear to men, and both beloved of jove.
  to either host your matchless worth is known,
  each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.
  but now the night extends her awful shade
  the goddess parts you  be the night obey'd.
  to whom great ajax his high soul express'd
   o sage! to hector be these words address'd.
  let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,
  let him demand the sanction of the night
  if first he ask'd it, i content obey,
  and cease the strife when hector shows the way.
   o first of greeks!  his noble foe rejoin'd
  whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,
  with strength of body, and with worth of mind!
  now martial law commands us to forbear
  hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,
  some future day shall lengthen out the strife,
  and let the gods decide of death or life!
  since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,
  and heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.
  return, brave ajax, to thy grecian friends,
  and joy the nations whom thy arm defends
  as i shall glad each chief, and trojan wife,
  who wearies heaven with vows for hector's life.
  but let us, on this memorable day,
  exchange some gift  that greece and troy may say,
  'not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend
  and each brave foe was in his soul a friend.'
  with that, a sword with stars of silver graced,
  the baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,
  he gave the greek. the generous greek bestow'd
  a radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd.
  then with majestic grace they quit the plain
  this seeks the grecian, that the phrygian train.
  the trojan bands returning hector wait,
  and hail with joy the champion of their state
  escaped great ajax, they survey him round,
  alive, unarm'd, and vigorous from his wound
  to troy's high gates the godlike man they bear
  their present triumph, as their late despair.
  but ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,
  the well-arm'd greeks to agamemnon lead.
  a steer for sacrifice the king design'd,
  of full five years, and of the nobler kind.
  the victim falls  they strip the smoking hide,
  the beast they quarter, and the joints divide
  then spread the tables, the repast prepare,
  each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
  the king himself  an honorary sign
  before great ajax placed the mighty chine.
  when now the rage of hunger was removed,
  nestor, in each persuasive art approved,
  the sage whose counsels long had sway'd the rest,
  in words like these his prudent thought express'd
   how dear, o kings! this fatal day has cost,
  what greeks are perish'd! what a people lost!
  what tides of blood have drench'd scamander's shore!
  what crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!
  then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow's light
  awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight
  some space at least permit the war to breathe,
  while we to flames our slaughter'd friends bequeath,
  from the red field their scatter'd bodies bear,
  and nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear
  so decent urns their snowy bones may keep,
  and pious children o'er their ashes weep.
  here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,
  high o'er them all a general tomb be raised
  next, to secure our camp and naval powers,
  raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers
  from space to space be ample gates around,
  for passing chariots  and a trench profound.
  so greece to combat shall in safety go,
  nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe.
  'twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved
  the sceptred kings of greece his words approved.
  meanwhile, convened at priam's palace-gate,
  the trojan peers in nightly council sate
  a senate void of order, as of choice
  their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.
  antenor, rising, thus demands their ear
   ye trojans, dardans, and auxiliars, hear!
  'tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,
  and i but move what every god requires
  let sparta's treasures be this hour restored,
  and argive helen own her ancient lord.
  the ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,
  our impious battles the just gods provoke.
  as this advice ye practise, or reject,
  so hope success, or dread the dire effect.
  the senior spoke and sate. to whom replied
  the graceful husband of the spartan bride
   cold counsels, trojan, may become thy years
  but sound ungrateful in a warrior's ears
  old man, if void of fallacy or art,
  thy words express the purpose of thy heart,
  thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given
  but wisdom has its date, assign'd by heaven.
  then hear me, princes of the trojan name!
  their treasures i'll restore, but not the dame
  my treasures too, for peace, i will resign
  but be this bright possession ever mine.
  'twas then, the growing discord to compose,
  slow from his seat the reverend priam rose
  his godlike aspect deep attention drew
  he paused, and these pacific words ensue
   ye trojans, dardans, and auxiliar bands!
  now take refreshment as the hour demands
  guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.
  till the new sun restores the cheerful light.
  then shall our herald, to the atrides sent,
  before their ships proclaim my son's intent.
  next let a truce be ask'd, that troy may burn
  her slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn
  that done, once more the fate of war be tried,
  and whose the conquest, mighty jove decide!
  the monarch spoke  the warriors snatch'd with haste
   each at his post in arms  a short repast.
  soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,
  to the black ships idaeus bent his way
  there, to the sons of mars, in council found,
  he raised his voice  the host stood listening round.
   ye sons of atreus, and ye greeks, give ear!
  the words of troy, and troy's great monarch, hear.
  pleased may ye hear  so heaven succeed my prayers
  what paris, author of the war, declares.
  the spoils and treasures he to ilion bore
   oh had he perish'd ere they touch'd our shore!
  he proffers injured greece  with large increase
  of added trojan wealth to buy the peace.
  but to restore the beauteous bride again,
  this greece demands, and troy requests in vain.
  next, o ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn
  our slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn.
  that done, once more the fate of war be tried,
  and whose the conquest, mighty jove decide!
  the greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke
  at length tydides rose, and rising spoke
   oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,
  their proffer'd wealth, nor even the spartan dame.
  let conquest make them ours  fate shakes their wall,
  and troy already totters to her fall.
  the admiring chiefs, and all the grecian name,
  with general shouts return'd him loud acclaim.
  then thus the king of kings rejects the peace
   herald! in him thou hear'st the voice of greece
  for what remains  let funeral flames be fed
  with heroes' corps  i war not with the dead
  go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,
  and gratify the manes of the slain.
  be witness, jove, whose thunder rolls on high!
  he said, and rear'd his sceptre to the sky.
  to sacred troy, where all her princes lay
  to wait the event, the herald bent his way.
  he came, and standing in the midst, explain'd
  the peace rejected, but the truce obtain'd.
  straight to their several cares the trojans move,
  some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove
  nor less the greeks, descending on the shore,
  hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore.
  and now from forth the chambers of the main,
  to shed his sacred light on earth again,
  arose the golden chariot of the day,
  and tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray.
  in mingled throngs the greek and trojan train
  through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.
  scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore,
  with dust dishonour'd, and deformed with gore.
  the wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed,
  and, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.
  sage priam check'd their grief  with silent haste
  the bodies decent on the piles were placed
  with melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd,
  and, sadly slow, to sacred troy return'd.
  nor less the greeks their pious sorrows shed,
  and decent on the pile dispose the dead
  the cold remains consume with equal care
  and slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.
  now, ere the morn had streak'd with reddening light
  the doubtful confines of the day and night,
  about the dying flames the greeks appear'd,
  and round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.
  then, to secure the camp and naval powers,
  they raised embattled walls with lofty towers
  from space to space were ample gates around,
  for passing chariots, and a trench profound
  of large extent  and deep in earth below,
  strong piles infix'd stood adverse to the foe.
  so toil'd the greeks  meanwhile the gods above,
  in shining circle round their father jove,
  amazed beheld the wondrous works of man
  then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began
   what mortals henceforth shall our power adore,
  our fanes frequent, our oracles implore,
  if the proud grecians thus successful boast
  their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?
  see the long walls extending to the main,
  no god consulted, and no victim slain!
  their fame shall fill the world's remotest ends,
  wide as the morn her golden beam extends
  while old laomedon's divine abodes,
  those radiant structures raised by labouring gods,
  shall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep.
  thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.
  the almighty thunderer with a frown replies,
  that clouds the world, and blackens half the skies
   strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make
  the solid earth's eternal basis shake!
  what cause of fear from mortal works could move
  the meanest subject of our realms above?
  where'er the sun's refulgent rays are cast,
  thy power is honour'd, and thy fame shall last.
  but yon proud work no future age shall view,
  no trace remain where once the glory grew.
  the sapp'd foundations by thy force shall fall,
  and, whelm'd beneath the waves, drop the huge wall
  vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore
  the ruin vanish'd, and the name no more.
  thus they in heaven  while, o'er the grecian train,
  the rolling sun descending to the main
  beheld the finish'd work. their bulls they slew
  back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.
  and now the fleet, arrived from lemnos' strands,
  with bacchus' blessings cheered the generous bands.
  of fragrant wines the rich eunaeus sent
  a thousant measures to the royal tent.
   eunaeus, whom hypsipyle of yore
  to jason, shepherd of his people, bore,
  the rest they purchased at their proper cost,
  and well the plenteous freight supplied the host
  each, in exchange, proportion'd treasures gave
  some, brass or iron  some, an ox, or slave.
  all night they feast, the greek and trojan powers
  those on the fields, and these within their towers.
  but jove averse the signs of wrath display'd,
  and shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade
  humbled they stood  pale horror seized on all,
  while the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.
  each pour'd to jove before the bowl was crown'd
  and large libations drench'd the thirsty ground
  then late, refresh'd with sleep from toils of fight,
  enjoy'd the balmy blessings of the night.
  aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,
  sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn
  when jove convened the senate of the skies,
  where high olympus' cloudy tops arise,
  the sire of gods his awful silence broke
  the heavens attentive trembled as he spoke
   celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,
  hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear
  the fix'd decree which not all heaven can move
  thou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!
  what god but enters yon forbidden field,
  who yields assistance, or but wills to yield,
  back to the skies with shame he shall be driven,
  gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven
  or far, oh far, from steep olympus thrown,
  low in the dark tartarean gulf shall groan,
  with burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,
  and lock'd by hell's inexorable doors
  as deep beneath the infernal centre hurl'd,
  as from that centre to the ethereal world.
  let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes
  and know, the almighty is the god of gods.
  league all your forces, then, ye powers above,
  join all, and try the omnipotence of jove.
  let down our golden everlasting chain
  whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main
  strive all, of mortal and immortal birth,
  to drag, by this, the thunderer down to earth
  ye strive in vain! if i but stretch this hand,
  i heave the gods, the ocean, and the land
  i fix the chain to great olympus' height,
  and the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!
  for such i reign, unbounded and above
  and such are men, and gods, compared to jove.
  the all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply
  a reverend horror silenced all the sky
  trembling they stood before their sovereign's look
  at length his best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke
   o first and greatest! god, by gods adored
  we own thy might, our father and our lord!
  but, ah! permit to pity human state
  if not to help, at least lament their fate.
  from fields forbidden we submiss refrain,
  with arms unaiding mourn our argives slain
  yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,
  or all must perish in the wrath of jove.
  the cloud-compelling god her suit approved,
  and smiled superior on his best beloved
  then call'd his coursers, and his chariot took
  the stedfast firmament beneath them shook
  rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd
  brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold
  of heaven's undrossy gold the gods array,
  refulgent, flash'd intolerable day.
  high on the throne he shines  his coursers fly
  between the extended earth and starry sky.
  but when to ida's topmost height he came,
   fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,
  where o'er her pointed summits proudly raised,
  his fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed
  there, from his radiant car, the sacred sire
  of gods and men released the steeds of fire
  blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced
  high on the cloudy point his seat he placed
  thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,
  the town, and tents, and navigable seas.
  now had the grecians snatch'd a short repast,
  and buckled on their shining arms with haste.
  troy roused as soon  for on this dreadful day
  the fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.
  the gates unfolding pour forth all their train
  squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain
  men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,
  the tumult thickens, and the skies resound
  and now with shouts the shocking armies closed,
  to lances lances, shields to shields opposed,
  host against host with shadowy legends drew,
  the sounding darts in iron tempests flew
  victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,
  triumphant shouts and dying groans arise
  with streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,
  and slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
  long as the morning beams, increasing bright,
  o'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light,
  commutual death the fate of war confounds,
  each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
  but when the sun the height of heaven ascends,
  the sire of gods his golden scales suspends,
  with equal hand  in these explored the fate
  of greece and troy, and poised the mighty weight
  press'd with its load, the grecian balance lies
  low sunk on earth, the trojan strikes the skies.
  then jove from ida's top his horrors spreads
  the clouds burst dreadful o'er the grecian heads
  thick lightnings flash  the muttering thunder rolls
  their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.
  before his wrath the trembling hosts retire
  the gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.
  nor great idomeneus that sight could bear,
  nor each stern ajax, thunderbolts of war
  nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain'd
  nestor alone, amidst the storm remain'd.
  unwilling he remain'd, for paris' dart
  had pierced his courser in a mortal part
  fix'd in the forehead, where the springing man
  curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain
  mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,
  paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.
  scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed
  the encumber'd chariot from the dying steed,
  when dreadful hector, thundering through the war,
  pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car.
  that day had stretch'd beneath his matchless hand
  the hoary monarch of the pylian band,
  but diomed beheld  from forth the crowd
  he rush'd, and on ulysses call'd aloud
   whither, oh whither does ulysses run?
  oh, flight unworthy great laertes' son!
  mix'd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,
  pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?
  oh turn and save from hector's direful rage
  the glory of the greeks, the pylian sage.
  his fruitless words are lost unheard in air,
  ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.
  but bold tydides to the rescue goes,
  a single warrior midst a host of foes
  before the coursers with a sudden spring
  he leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king
   great perils, father! wait the unequal fight
  these younger champions will oppress thy might.
  thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,
  weak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.
  then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car
  observe the steeds of tros, renown'd in war.
  practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,
  to dare the fight, or urge the rapid race
  these late obey'd  neas' guiding rein
  leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train
  with these against yon trojans will we go,
  nor shall great hector want an equal foe
  fierce as he is, even he may learn to fear
  the thirsty fury of my flying spear.
  thus said the chief  and nestor, skill'd in war,
  approves his counsel, and ascends the car
  the steeds he left, their trusty servants hold
  eurymedon, and sthenelus the bold
  the reverend charioteer directs the course,
  and strains his aged arm to lash the horse.
  hector they face  unknowing how to fear,
  fierce he drove on  tydides whirl'd his spear.
  the spear with erring haste mistook its way,
  but plunged in eniopeus' bosom lay.
  his opening hand in death forsakes the rein
  the steeds fly back  he falls, and spurns the plain.
  great hector sorrows for his servant kill'd,
  yet unrevenged permits to press the field
  till, to supply his place and rule the car,
  rose archeptolemus, the fierce in war.
  and now had death and horror cover'd all
  like timorous flocks the trojans in their wall
  inclosed had bled  but jove with awful sound
  roll'd the big thunder o'er the vast profound
  full in tydides' face the lightning flew
  the ground before him flamed with sulphur blue
  the quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight
  and nestor's trembling hand confess'd his fright
  he dropp'd the reins  and, shook with sacred dread,
  thus, turning, warn'd the intrepid diomed
   o chief! too daring in thy friend's defence
  retire advised, and urge the chariot hence.
  this day, averse, the sovereign of the skies
  assists great hector, and our palm denies.
  some other sun may see the happier hour,
  when greece shall conquer by his heavenly power.
  'tis not in man his fix'd decree to move
  the great will glory to submit to jove.
   o reverend prince!  tydides thus replies
  thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
  but ah, what grief! should haughty hector boast
  i fled inglorious to the guarded coast.
  before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,
  o'erwhelm me, earth  and hide a warrior's shame!
  to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
   gods! can thy courage fear the phrygian's pride?
  hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?
  not those who felt thy arm, the dardan host,
  nor troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost
  not even a phrygian dame, who dreads the sword
  that laid in dust her loved, lamented lord.
  he said, and, hasty, o'er the gasping throng
  drives the swift steeds  the chariot smokes along
  the shouts of trojans thicken in the wind
  the storm of hissing javelins pours behind.
  then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,
  pleased, hector braves the warrior as he flies.
   go, mighty hero! graced above the rest
  in seats of council and the sumptuous feast
  now hope no more those honours from thy train
  go less than woman, in the form of man!
  to scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,
  to lead in exile the fair phrygian dames,
  thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled
  this arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead.
  now fears dissuade him, and now hopes invite.
  to stop his coursers, and to stand the fight
  thrice turn'd the chief, and thrice imperial jove
  on ida's summits thunder'd from above.
  great hector heard  he saw the flashing light,
   the sign of conquest,  and thus urged the fight
   hear, every trojan, lycian, dardan band,
  all famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.
  be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,
  your great forefathers' glories, and your own.
  heard ye the voice of jove? success and fame
  await on troy, on greece eternal shame.
  in vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,
  weak bulwarks  destined by this arm to fall.
  high o'er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,
  and pass victorious o'er the levell'd mound.
  soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,
  fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand
  till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,
  all greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires.
  furious he said  then bending o'er the yoke,
  encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke
   now, xanthus,  thon, lampus, urge the chase,
  and thou, podargus! prove thy generous race
  be fleet, be fearless, this important day,
  and all your master's well-spent care repay.
  for this, high-fed, in plenteous stalls ye stand,
  served with pure wheat, and by a princess' hand
  for this my spouse, of great aetion's line,
  so oft has steep'd the strengthening grain in wine.
  now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll'd
  give me to seize rich nestor's shield of gold
  from tydeus' shoulders strip the costly load,
  vulcanian arms, the labour of a god
  these if we gain, then victory, ye powers!
  this night, this glorious night, the fleet is ours!
  that heard, deep anguish stung saturnia's soul
  she shook her throne, that shook the starry pole
  and thus to neptune   thou, whose force can make
  the stedfast earth from her foundations shake,
  seest thou the greeks by fates unjust oppress'd,
  nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?
  yet  gae, helice, thy power obey,
  and gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.
  would all the deities of greece combine,
  in vain the gloomy thunderer might repine
  sole should he sit, with scarce a god to friend,
  and see his trojans to the shades descend
  such be the scene from his idaean bower
  ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!
  neptune with wrath rejects the rash design
   what rage, what madness, furious queen! is thine?
  i war not with the highest. all above
  submit and tremble at the hand of jove.
  now godlike hector, to whose matchless might
  jove gave the glory of the destined fight,
  squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields
  with close-ranged chariots, and with thicken'd shields.
  where the deep trench in length extended lay,
  compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,
  a dreadful front! they shake the brands, and threat
  with long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.
  the king of men, by juno's self inspired,
  toil'd through the tents, and all his army fired.
  swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand
  his purple robe, bright ensign of command.
  high on the midmost bark the king appear'd
  there, from ulysses' deck, his voice was heard
  to ajax and achilles reach'd the sound,
  whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.
   o argives! shame of human race!  he cried
  the hollow vessels to his voice replied,
  where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,
  your hasty triumphs on the lemnian shore?
  each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,
  while the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows
  but who to meet one martial man is found,
  when the fight rages, and the flames surround?
  o mighty jove! o sire of the distress'd!
  was ever king like me, like me oppress'd?
  with power immense, with justice arm'd in vain
  my glory ravish'd, and my people slain!
  to thee my vows were breathed from every shore
  what altar smoked not with our victims' gore?
  with fat of bulls i fed the constant flame,
  and ask'd destruction to the trojan name.
  now, gracious god! far humbler our demand
  give these at least to 'scape from hector's hand,
  and save the relics of the grecian land!
  thus pray'd the king, and heaven's great father heard
  his vows, in bitterness of soul preferr'd
  the wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,
  and gives the people to their monarch's prayers.
  his eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,
  a fawn his talons truss'd,  divine portent!
  high o'er the wondering hosts he soar'd above,
  who paid their vows to panomphaean jove
  then let the prey before his altar fall
  the greeks beheld, and transport seized on all
  encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,
  and fierce on troy with doubled fury drive.
  tydides first, of all the grecian force,
  o'er the broad ditch impell'd his foaming horse,
  pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,
  and dyed his javelin red with trojan gore.
  young agelaus  phradmon was his sire
  with flying coursers shunn'd his dreadful ire
  struck through the back, the phrygian fell oppress'd
  the dart drove on, and issued at his breast
  headlong he quits the car  his arms resound
  his ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.
  forth rush a tide of greeks, the passage freed
  the atridae first, the ajaces next succeed
  meriones, like mars in arms renown'd,
  and godlike idomen, now passed the mound
  evaemon's son next issues to the foe,
  and last young teucer with his bended bow.
  secure behind the telamonian shield
  the skilful archer wide survey'd the field,
  with every shaft some hostile victim slew,
  then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew
  the conscious infant so, when fear alarms,
  retires for safety to the mother's arms.
  thus ajax guards his brother in the field,
  moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.
  who first by teucer's mortal arrows bled?
  orsilochus  then fell ormenus dead
  the godlike lycophon next press'd the plain,
  with chromius, daetor, ophelestes slain
  bold hamopaon breathless sunk to ground
  the bloody pile great melanippus crown'd.
  heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,
  a trojan ghost attending every dart.
  great agamemnon views with joyful eye
  the ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly
   o youth forever dear!  the monarch cried
  thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried
  thy brave example shall retrieve our host,
  thy country's saviour, and thy father's boast!
  sprung from an alien's bed thy sire to grace,
  the vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace
  proud of his boy, he own'd the generous flame,
  and the brave son repays his cares with fame.
  now hear a monarch's vow  if heaven's high powers
  give me to raze troy's long-defended towers
  whatever treasures greece for me design,
  the next rich honorary gift be thine
  some golden tripod, or distinguished car,
  with coursers dreadful in the ranks of war
  or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,
  shall recompense the warrior's toils with love.
  to this the chief   with praise the rest inspire,
  nor urge a soul already fill'd with fire.
  what strength i have, be now in battle tried,
  till every shaft in phrygian blood be dyed.
  since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,
  still aim'd at hector have i bent my bow
  eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,
  and eight bold heroes by their points lie dead
  but sure some god denies me to destroy
  this fury of the field, this dog of troy.
  he said, and twang'd the string. the weapon flies
  at hector's breast, and sings along the skies
  he miss'd the mark  but pierced gorgythio's heart,
  and drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart.
   fair castianira, nymph of form divine,
  this offspring added to king priam's line.
  as full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,
  decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain
  so sinks the youth  his beauteous head, depress'd
  beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.
  another shaft the raging archer drew,
  that other shaft with erring fury flew,
   from hector, phoebus turn'd the flying wound,
  yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground
  thy breast, brave archeptolemus! it tore,
  and dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.
  headlong he falls  his sudden fall alarms
  the steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.
  hector with grief his charioteer beheld
  all pale and breathless on the sanguine field
  then bids cebriones direct the rein,
  quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.
  dreadful he shouts  from earth a stone he took,
  and rush'd on teucer with the lifted rock.
  the youth already strain'd the forceful yew
  the shaft already to his shoulder drew
  the feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,
  touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite
  there, where the juncture knits the channel bone,
  the furious chief discharged the craggy stone
  the bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,
  and his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.
  he fell  but ajax his broad shield display'd,
  and screen'd his brother with the mighty shade
  till great alaster, and mecistheus, bore
  the batter'd archer groaning to the shore.
  troy yet found grace before the olympian sire,
  he arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire.
  the greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,
  or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.
  first of the foe, great hector march'd along,
  with terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.
  as the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,
  with beating bosom, and with eager pace,
  hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,
  guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels
  thus oft the grecians turn'd, but still they flew
  thus following, hector still the hindmost slew.
  when flying they had pass'd the trench profound,
  and many a chief lay gasping on the ground
  before the ships a desperate stand they made,
  and fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.
  fierce on his rattling chariot hector came
  his eyes like gorgon shot a sanguine flame
  that wither'd all their host  like mars he stood
  dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!
  their strong distress the wife of jove survey'd
  then pensive thus, to war's triumphant maid
   o daughter of that god, whose arm can wield
  the avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!
  now, in this moment of her last despair,
  shall wretched greece no more confess our care,
  condemn'd to suffer the full force of fate,
  and drain the dregs of heaven's relentless hate?
  gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?
  what numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!
  what power divine shall hector's wrath assuage?
  still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!
  so spake the imperial regent of the skies
  to whom the goddess with the azure eyes
   long since had hector stain'd these fields with gore,
  stretch'd by some argive on his native shore
  but he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,
  mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands
  the stubborn god, inflexible and hard,
  forgets my service and deserved reward
  saved i, for this, his favourite son distress'd,
  by stern eurystheus with long labours press'd?
  he begg'd, with tears he begg'd, in deep dismay
  i shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.
  oh had my wisdom known this dire event,
  when to grim pluto's gloomy gates he went
  the triple dog had never felt his chain,
  nor styx been cross'd, nor hell explored in vain.
  averse to me of all his heaven of gods,
  at thetis' suit the partial thunderer nods
  to grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,
  my hopes are frustrate, and my greeks undone.
  some future day, perhaps, he may be moved
  to call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.
  haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride
  myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.
  then, goddess! say, shall hector glory then?
   that terror of the greeks, that man of men
  when juno's self, and pallas shall appear,
  all dreadful in the crimson walks of war!
  what mighty trojan then, on yonder shore,
  expiring, pale, and terrible no more,
  shall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?
  she ceased, and juno rein'd the steeds with care
   heaven's awful empress, saturn's other heir
  pallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,
  with flowers adorn'd, with art immortal crown'd
  the radiant robe her sacred fingers wove
  floats in rich waves, and spreads the court of jove.
  her father's arms her mighty limbs invest,
  his cuirass blazes on her ample breast.
  the vigorous power the trembling car ascends
  shook by her arm, the massy javelin bends
  huge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns
  proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.
  saturnia lends the lash  the coursers fly
  smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky.
  heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,
  heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged hours.
  commission'd in alternate watch they stand,
  the sun's bright portals and the skies command
  close, or unfold, the eternal gates of day
  bar heaven with clouds, or roll those clouds away.
  the sounding hinges ring, the clouds divide.
  prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide.
  but jove, incensed, from ida's top survey'd,
  and thus enjoin'd the many-colour'd maid.
   thaumantia! mount the winds, and stop their car
  against the highest who shall wage the war?
  if furious yet they dare the vain debate,
  thus have i spoke, and what i speak is fate
  their coursers crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,
  their car in fragments, scatter'd o'er the sky
  my lightning these rebellious shall confound,
  and hurl them flaming, headlong, to the ground,
  condemn'd for ten revolving years to weep
  the wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.
  so shall minerva learn to fear our ire,
  nor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.
  for juno, headstrong and imperious still,
  she claims some title to transgress our will.
  swift as the wind, the various-colour'd maid
  from ida's top her golden wings display'd
  to great olympus' shining gate she flies,
  there meets the chariot rushing down the skies,
  restrains their progress from the bright abodes,
  and speaks the mandate of the sire of gods.
   what frenzy goddesses! what rage can move
  celestial minds to tempt the wrath of jove?
  desist, obedient to his high command
  this is his word  and know his word shall stand
  his lightning your rebellion shall confound,
  and hurl ye headlong, flaming, to the ground
  your horses crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,
  your car in fragments scatter'd o'er the sky
  yourselves condemn'd ten rolling years to weep
  the wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.
  so shall minerva learn to fear his ire,
  nor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.
  for juno, headstrong and imperious still,
  she claims some title to transgress his will
  but thee, what desperate insolence has driven
  to lift thy lance against the king of heaven?
  then, mounting on the pinions of the wind,
  she flew  and juno thus her rage resign'd
   o daughter of that god, whose arm can wield
  the avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield
  no more let beings of superior birth
  contend with jove for this low race of earth
  triumphant now, now miserably slain,
  they breathe or perish as the fates ordain
  but jove's high counsels full effect shall find
  and, ever constant, ever rule mankind.
  she spoke, and backward turn'd her steeds of light,
  adorn'd with manes of gold, and heavenly bright.
  the hours unloosed them, panting as they stood,
  and heap'd their mangers with ambrosial food.
  there tied, they rest in high celestial stalls
  the chariot propp'd against the crystal walls,
  the pensive goddesses, abash'd, controll'd,
  mix with the gods, and fill their seats of gold.
  and now the thunderer meditates his flight
  from ida's summits to the olympian height.
  swifter than thought, the wheels instinctive fly,
  flame through the vast of air, and reach the sky.
  'twas neptune's charge his coursers to unbrace,
  and fix the car on its immortal base
  there stood the chariot, beaming forth its rays,
  till with a snowy veil he screen'd the blaze.
  he, whose all-conscious eyes the world behold,
  the eternal thunderer sat, enthroned in gold.
  high heaven the footstool of his feet he makes,
  and wide beneath him all olympus shakes.
  trembling afar the offending powers appear'd,
  confused and silent, for his frown they fear'd.
  he saw their soul, and thus his word imparts
   pallas and juno! say, why heave your hearts?
  soon was your battle o'er  proud troy retired
  before your face, and in your wrath expired.
  but know, whoe'er almighty power withstand!
  unmatch'd our force, unconquer'd is our hand
  who shall the sovereign of the skies control?
  not all the gods that crown the starry pole.
  your hearts shall tremble, if our arms we take,
  and each immortal nerve with horror shake.
  for thus i speak, and what i speak shall stand
  what power soe'er provokes our lifted hand,
  on this our hill no more shall hold his place
  cut off, and exiled from the ethereal race.
  juno and pallas grieving hear the doom,
  but feast their souls on ilion's woes to come.
  though secret anger swell'd minerva's breast,
  the prudent goddess yet her wrath repress'd
  but juno, impotent of rage, replies
   what hast thou said, o tyrant of the skies!
  strength and omnipotence invest thy throne
  'tis thine to punish  ours to grieve alone.
  for greece we grieve, abandon'd by her fate
  to drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate.
  from fields forbidden we submiss refrain,
  with arms unaiding see our argives slain
  yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move,
  lest all should perish in the rage of jove.
  the goddess thus  and thus the god replies,
  who swells the clouds, and blackens all the skies
   the morning sun, awaked by loud alarms,
  shall see the almighty thunderer in arms.
  what heaps of argives then shall load the plain,
  those radiant eyes shall view, and view in vain.
  nor shall great hector cease the rage of fight,
  the navy flaming, and thy greeks in flight,
  even till the day when certain fates ordain
  that stern achilles  his patroclus slain
  shall rise in vengeance, and lay waste the plain.
  for such is fate, nor canst thou turn its course
  with all thy rage, with all thy rebel force.
  fly, if thy wilt, to earth's remotest bound,
  where on her utmost verge the seas resound
  where cursed iapetus and saturn dwell,
  fast by the brink, within the streams of hell
  no sun e'er gilds the gloomy horrors there
  no cheerful gales refresh the lazy air
  there arm once more the bold titanian band
  and arm in vain  for what i will, shall stand.
  now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light,
  and drew behind the cloudy veil of night
  the conquering trojans mourn his beams decay'd
  the greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade.
  the victors keep the field  and hector calls
  a martial council near the navy walls
  these to scamander's bank apart he led,
  where thinly scatter'd lay the heaps of dead.
  the assembled chiefs, descending on the ground,
  attend his order, and their prince surround.
  a massy spear he bore of mighty strength,
  of full ten cubits was the lance's length
  the point was brass, refulgent to behold,
  fix'd to the wood with circling rings of gold
  the noble hector on his lance reclined,
  and, bending forward, thus reveal'd his mind
   ye valiant trojans, with attention hear!
  ye dardan bands, and generous aids, give ear!
  this day, we hoped, would wrap in conquering flame
  greece with her ships, and crown our toils with fame.
  but darkness now, to save the cowards, falls,
  and guards them trembling in their wooden walls.
  obey the night, and use her peaceful hours
  our steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.
  straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought,
  and strengthening bread and generous wine be brought
  wide o'er the field, high blazing to the sky,
  let numerous fires the absent sun supply,
  the flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise,
  till the bright morn her purple beam displays
  lest, in the silence and the shades of night,
  greece on her sable ships attempt her flight.
  not unmolested let the wretches gain
  their lofty decks, or safely cleave the main
  some hostile wound let every dart bestow,
  some lasting token of the phrygian foe,
  wounds, that long hence may ask their spouses' care.
  and warn their children from a trojan war.
  now through the circuit of our ilion wall,
  let sacred heralds sound the solemn call
  to bid the sires with hoary honours crown'd,
  and beardless youths, our battlements surround.
  firm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,
  and let the matrons hang with lights the towers
  lest, under covert of the midnight shade,
  the insidious foe the naked town invade.
  suffice, to-night, these orders to obey
  a nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.
  the gods, i trust, shall give to hector's hand
  from these detested foes to free the land,
  who plough'd, with fates averse, the watery way
  for trojan vultures a predestined prey.
  our common safety must be now the care
  but soon as morning paints the fields of air,
  sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,
  and the fired fleet behold the battle rage.
  then, then shall hector and tydides prove
  whose fates are heaviest in the scales of jove.
  to-morrow's light  o haste the glorious morn!
  shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,
  with this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,
  and prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.
  certain as this, oh! might my days endure,
  from age inglorious, and black death secure
  so might my life and glory know no bound,
  like pallas worshipp'd, like the sun renown'd!
  as the next dawn, the last they shall enjoy,
  shall crush the greeks, and end the woes of troy.
  the leader spoke. from all his host around
  shouts of applause along the shores resound.
  each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied,
  and fix'd their headstalls to his chariot-side.
  fat sheep and oxen from the town are led,
  with generous wine, and all-sustaining bread,
  full hecatombs lay burning on the shore
  the winds to heaven the curling vapours bore.
  ungrateful offering to the immortal powers!
  whose wrath hung heavy o'er the trojan towers
  nor priam nor his sons obtain'd their grace
  proud troy they hated, and her guilty race.
  the troops exulting sat in order round,
  and beaming fires illumined all the ground.
  as when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,
  o'er heaven's pure azure spreads her sacred light,
  when not a breath disturbs the deep serene,
  and not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene,
  around her throne the vivid planets roll,
  and stars unnumber'd gild the glowing pole,
  o'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,
  and tip with silver every mountain's head
  then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,
  a flood of glory bursts from all the skies
  the conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,
  eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.
  so many flames before proud ilion blaze,
  and lighten glimmering xanthus with their rays.
  the long reflections of the distant fires
  gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.
  a thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,
  and shoot a shady lustre o'er the field.
  full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,
  whose umber'd arms, by fits, thick flashes send,
  loud neigh the coursers o'er their heaps of corn,
  and ardent warriors wait the rising morn.
  thus joyful troy maintain'd the watch of night
  while fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,
  and heaven-bred horror, on the grecian part,
  sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.
  as from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,
  a double tempest of the west and north
  swells o'er the sea, from thracia's frozen shore,
  heaps waves on waves, and bids the  gean roar
  this way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd
  such various passions urged the troubled host,
  great agamemnon grieved above the rest
  superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast
  himself his orders to the heralds bears,
  to bid to council all the grecian peers,
  but bid in whispers  these surround their chief,
  in solemn sadness and majestic grief.
  the king amidst the mournful circle rose
  down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.
  so silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,
  in sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.
  with more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd
  words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast
   ye sons of greece! partake your leader's care
  fellows in arms and princes of the war!
  of partial jove too justly we complain,
  and heavenly oracles believed in vain.
  a safe return was promised to our toils,
  with conquest honour'd and enrich'd with spoils
  now shameful flight alone can save the host
  our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.
  so jove decrees, almighty lord of all!
  jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,
  who shakes the feeble props of human trust,
  and towers and armies humbles to the dust.
  haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,
  haste to the joys our native country yields
  spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,
  nor hope the fall of heaven-defended troy.
  he said  deep silence held the grecian band
  silent, unmov'd in dire dismay they stand
  a pensive scene! till tydeus' warlike son
  roll'd on the king his eyes, and thus begun
   when kings advise us to renounce our fame,
  first let him speak who first has suffer'd shame.
  if i oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,
  the laws of council bid my tongue be bold.
  thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,
  durst brand my courage, and defame my might
  nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd,
  the greeks stood witness, all our army heard.
  the gods, o chief! from whom our honours spring,
  the gods have made thee but by halves a king
  they gave thee sceptres, and a wide command
  they gave dominion o'er the seas and land
  the noblest power that might the world control
  they gave thee not--a brave and virtuous soul.
  is this a general's voice, that would suggest
  fears like his own to every grecian breast?
  confiding in our want of worth, he stands
  and if we fly, 'tis what our king commands.
  go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain
  ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main
  a noble care the grecians shall employ,
  to combat, conquer, and extirpate troy.
  here greece shall stay  or, if all greece retire,
  myself shall stay, till troy or i expire
  myself, and sthenelus, will fight for fame
  god bade us fight, and 'twas with god we came.
  he ceased  the greeks loud acclamations raise,
  and voice to voice resounds tydides' praise.
  wise nestor then his reverend figure rear'd
  he spoke  the host in still attention heard
   o truly great! in whom the gods have join'd
  such strength of body with such force of mind
  in conduct, as in courage, you excel,
  still first to act what you advise so well.
  these wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,
  applauding greece with common voice approves.
  kings thou canst blame  a bold but prudent youth
  and blame even kings with praise, because with truth.
  and yet those years that since thy birth have run
  would hardly style thee nestor's youngest son.
  then let me add what yet remains behind,
  a thought unfinish'd in that generous mind
  age bids me speak! nor shall the advice i bring
  distaste the people, or offend the king
   cursed is the man, and void of law and right,
  unworthy property, unworthy light,
  unfit for public rule, or private care,
  that wretch, that monster, who delights in war
  whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,
  to tear his country, and his kind destroy!
  this night, refresh and fortify thy train
  between the trench and wall let guards remain
  be that the duty of the young and bold
  but thou, o king, to council call the old
  great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares
  thy high commands must spirit all our wars.
  with thracian wines recruit thy honour'd guests,
  for happy counsels flow from sober feasts.
  wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress'd,
  and such a monarch as can choose the best.
  see what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,
  how near our fleet approach the trojan fires!
  who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?
  what eye beholds them, and can close to-night?
  this dreadful interval determines all
  to-morrow, troy must flame, or greece must fall.
  thus spoke the hoary sage  the rest obey
  swift through the gates the guards direct their way.
  his son was first to pass the lofty mound,
  the generous thrasymed, in arms renown'd
  next him, ascalaphus, ialmen, stood,
  the double offspring of the warrior-god
  deipyrus, aphareus, merion join,
  and lycomed of creon's noble line.
  seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,
  and each bold chief a hundred spears commands.
  the fires they light, to short repasts they fall,
  some line the trench, and others man the wall.
  the king of men, on public counsels bent,
  convened the princes in his ample tent,
  each seized a portion of the kingly feast,
  but stay'd his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.
  then nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,
  and slowly rising, thus the council moved.
   monarch of nations! whose superior sway
  assembled states, and lords of earth obey,
  the laws and sceptres to thy hand are given,
  and millions own the care of thee and heaven.
  o king! the counsels of my age attend
  with thee my cares begin, with thee must end.
  thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,
  pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,
  to see no wholesome motion be withstood,
  and ratify the best for public good.
  nor, though a meaner give advice, repine,
  but follow it, and make the wisdom thine.
  hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,
  at once my present judgment and my past.
  when from pelides' tent you forced the maid,
  i first opposed, and faithful, durst dissuade
  but bold of soul, when headlong fury fired,
  you wronged the man, by men and gods admired
  now seek some means his fatal wrath to end,
  with prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend.
  to whom the king.  with justice hast thou shown
  a prince's faults, and i with reason own.
  that happy man, whom jove still honours most,
  is more than armies, and himself a host.
  bless'd in his love, this wondrous hero stands
  heaven fights his war, and humbles all our bands.
  fain would my heart, which err'd through frantic rage,
  the wrathful chief and angry gods assuage.
  if gifts immense his mighty soul can bow,
  hear, all ye greeks, and witness what i vow.
  ten weighty talents of the purest gold,
  and twice ten vases of refulgent mould
  seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
  yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame
  twelve steeds unmatch'd in fleetness and in force,
  and still victorious in the dusty course
   rich were the man whose ample stores exceed
  the prizes purchased by their winged speed
  seven lovely captives of the lesbian line,
  skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,
  the same i chose for more than vulgar charms,
  when lesbos sank beneath the hero's arms
  all these, to buy his friendship, shall be paid,
  and join'd with these the long-contested maid
  with all her charms, briseis i resign,
  and solemn swear those charms were never mine
  untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,
  pure from my arms, and guiltless of my loves,
  these instant shall be his  and if the powers
  give to our arms proud ilion's hostile towers,
  then shall he store  when greece the spoil divides
  with gold and brass his loaded navy's sides
  besides, full twenty nymphs of trojan race
  with copious love shall crown his warm embrace,
  such as himself will choose  who yield to none,
  or yield to helen's heavenly charms alone.
  yet hear me further  when our wars are o'er,
  if safe we land on argos' fruitful shore,
  there shall he live my son, our honours share,
  and with orestes' self divide my care.
  yet more--three daughters in my court are bred,
  and each well worthy of a royal bed
  laodice and iphigenia fair,
  and bright chrysothemis with golden hair
  her let him choose whom most his eyes approve,
  i ask no presents, no reward for love
  myself will give the dower  so vast a store
  as never father gave a child before.
  seven ample cities shall confess his sway,
  him enope, and pherae him obey,
  cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,
  and sacred pedasus for vines renown'd
   pea fair, the pastures hira yields,
  and rich antheia with her flowery fields
  the whole extent to pylos' sandy plain,
  along the verdant margin of the main
  there heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil
  bold are the men, and generous is the soil
  there shall he reign, with power and justice crown'd,
  and rule the tributary realms around.
  all this i give, his vengeance to control,
  and sure all this may move his mighty soul.
  pluto, the grisly god, who never spares,
  who feels no mercy, and who hears no prayers,
  lives dark and dreadful in deep hell's abodes,
  and mortals hate him, as the worst of gods
  great though he be, it fits him to obey,
  since more than his my years, and more my sway.
  the monarch thus. the reverend nestor then
   great agamemnon! glorious king of men!
  such are thy offers as a prince may take,
  and such as fits a generous king to make.
  let chosen delegates this hour be sent
   myself will name them  to pelides' tent.
  let phoenix lead, revered for hoary age,
  great ajax next, and ithacus the sage.
  yet more to sanctify the word you send,
  let hodius and eurybates attend.
  now pray to jove to grant what greece demands
  pray in deep silence,      and with purest hands.
  he said  and all approved. the heralds bring
  the cleansing water from the living spring.
  the youth with wine the sacred goblets crown'd,
  and large libations drench'd the sands around.
  the rite perform'd, the chiefs their thirst allay,
  then from the royal tent they take their way
  wise nestor turns on each his careful eye,
  forbids to offend, instructs them to apply
  much he advised them all, ulysses most,
  to deprecate the chief, and save the host.
  through the still night they march, and hear the roar
  of murmuring billows on the sounding shore.
  to neptune, ruler of the seas profound,
  whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround,
  they pour forth vows, their embassy to bless,
  and calm the rage of stern  acides.
  and now, arrived, where on the sandy bay
  the myrmidonian tents and vessels lay
  amused at ease, the godlike man they found,
  pleased with the solemn harp's harmonious sound.
   the well wrought harp from conquered thebae came
  of polish'd silver was its costly frame.
  with this he soothes his angry soul, and sings
  the immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.
  patroclus only of the royal train,
  placed in his tent, attends the lofty strain
  full opposite he sat, and listen'd long,
  in silence waiting till he ceased the song.
  unseen the grecian embassy proceeds
  to his high tent  the great ulysses leads.
  achilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,
  leap'd from his seat, and laid the harp aside.
  with like surprise arose menoetius' son
  pelides grasp'd their hands, and thus begun
   princes, all hail! whatever brought you here.
  or strong necessity, or urgent fear
  welcome, though greeks! for not as foes ye came
  to me more dear than all that bear the name.
  with that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,
  and placed in seats with purple carpets spread.
  then thus-- patroclus, crown a larger bowl,
  mix purer wine, and open every soul.
  of all the warriors yonder host can send,
  thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend.
  he said  patroclus o'er the blazing fire
  heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire
  the brazen vase automedon sustains,
  which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.
  achilles at the genial feast presides,
  the parts transfixes, and with skill divides.
  meanwhile patroclus sweats, the fire to raise
  the tent is brighten'd with the rising blaze
  then, when the languid flames at length subside,
  he strows a bed of glowing embers wide,
  above the coals the smoking fragments turns
  and sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns
  with bread the glittering canisters they load,
  which round the board menoetius' son bestow'd
  himself, opposed to ulysses full in sight,
  each portion parts, and orders every rite.
  the first fat offering to the immortals due,
  amidst the greedy flames patroclus threw
  then each, indulging in the social feast,
  his thirst and hunger soberly repress'd.
  that done, to phoenix ajax gave the sign
  not unperceived  ulysses crown'd with wine
  the foaming bowl, and instant thus began,
  his speech addressing to the godlike man.
   health to achilles! happy are thy guests!
  not those more honour'd whom atrides feasts
  though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,
  that, agamemnon's regal tent affords
  but greater cares sit heavy on our souls,
  nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.
  what scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!
  the dead we mourn, and for the living fear
  greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,
  and owns no help but from thy saving hands
  troy and her aids for ready vengeance call
  their threatening tents already shade our wall
  hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,
  and point at every ship their vengeful flame!
  for them the father of the gods declares,
  theirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.
  see, full of jove, avenging hector rise!
  see! heaven and earth the raging chief defies
  what fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!
  he waits but for the morn, to sink in flame
  the ships, the greeks, and all the grecian name.
  heavens! how my country's woes distract my mind,
  lest fate accomplish all his rage design'd!
  and must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay
  in trojan dust, and this the fatal day?
  return, achilles  oh return, though late,
  to save thy greeks, and stop the course of fate
  if in that heart or grief or courage lies,
  rise to redeem  ah, yet to conquer, rise!
  the day may come, when, all our warriors slain,
  that heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain
  regard in time, o prince divinely brave!
  those wholesome counsels which thy father gave.
  when peleus in his aged arms embraced
  his parting son, these accents were his last
   'my child! with strength, with glory, and success,
  thy arms may juno and minerva bless!
  trust that to heaven  but thou, thy cares engage
  to calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage
  from gentler manners let thy glory grow,
  and shun contention, the sure source of woe
  that young and old may in thy praise combine,
  the virtues of humanity be thine--'
  this now-despised advice thy father gave
  ah! check thy anger  and be truly brave.
  if thou wilt yield to great atrides' prayers,
  gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares
  if not--but hear me, while i number o'er
  the proffer'd presents, an exhaustless store.
  ten weighty talents of the purest gold,
  and twice ten vases of refulgent mould
  seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
  yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame
  twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,
  and still victorious in the dusty course
   rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed
  the prizes purchased by their winged speed
  seven lovely captives of the lesbian line,
  skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,
  the same he chose for more than vulgar charms,
  when lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.
  all these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid,
  and, join'd with these, the long-contested maid
  with all her charms, briseis he'll resign,
  and solemn swear those charms were only thine
  untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,
  pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.
  these instant shall be thine  and if the powers
  give to our arms proud ilion's hostile towers,
  then shalt thou store  when greece the spoil divides
  with gold and brass thy loaded navy's sides.
  besides, full twenty nymphs of trojan race
  with copious love shall crown thy warm embrace
  such as thyself shall chose  who yield to none,
  or yield to helen's heavenly charms alone.
  yet hear me further  when our wars are o'er,
  if safe we land on argos' fruitful shore,
  there shalt thou live his son, his honour share,
  and with orestes' self divide his care.
  yet more--three daughters in his court are bred,
  and each well worthy of a royal bed
  laodice and iphigenia fair,
  and bright chrysothemis with golden hair
  her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve
  he asks no presents, no reward for love
  himself will give the dower  so vast a store
  as never father gave a child before.
  seven ample cities shall confess thy sway,
  the enope and pherae thee obey,
  cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,
  and sacred pedasus, for vines renown'd
   pea fair, the pastures hira yields,
  and rich antheia with her flowery fields
  the whole extent to pylos' sandy plain,
  along the verdant margin of the main.
  there heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil
  bold are the men, and generous is the soil.
  there shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown'd,
  and rule the tributary realms around.
  such are the proffers which this day we bring,
  such the repentance of a suppliant king.
  but if all this, relentless, thou disdain,
  if honour and if interest plead in vain,
  yet some redress to suppliant greece afford,
  and be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.
  if no regard thy suffering country claim,
  hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame
  for now that chief, whose unresisted ire
  made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,
  proud hector, now, the unequal fight demands,
  and only triumphs to deserve thy hands.
  then thus the goddess-born   ulysses, hear
  a faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear
  what in my secret soul is understood,
  my tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.
  let greece then know, my purpose i retain
  nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.
  who dares think one thing, and another tell,
  my heart detests him as the gates of hell.
   then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend,
  which nor atrides nor his greeks can bend
  long toils, long perils in their cause i bore,
  but now the unfruitful glories charm no more.
  fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,
  the wretch and hero find their prize the same.
  alike regretted in the dust he lies,
  who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.
  of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,
  a life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?
  as the bold bird her helpless young attends,
  from danger guards them, and from want defends
  in search of prey she wings the spacious air,
  and with the untasted food supplies her care
  for thankless greece such hardships have i braved,
  her wives, her infants, by my labours saved
  long sleepless nights in heavy arms i stood,
  and sweat laborious days in dust and blood.
  i sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,
  and twelve lay smoking on the trojan plain
  then at atrides' haughty feet were laid
  the wealth i gathered, and the spoils i made.
  your mighty monarch these in peace possess'd
  some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.
  some present, too, to every prince was paid
  and every prince enjoys the gift he made
  i only must refund, of all his train
  see what pre-eminence our merits gain!
  my spoil alone his greedy soul delights
  my spouse alone must bless his lustful nights
  the woman, let him  as he may  enjoy
  but what's the quarrel, then, of greece to troy?
  what to these shores the assembled nations draws,
  what calls for vengeance but a woman's cause?
  are fair endowments and a beauteous face
  beloved by none but those of atreus' race?
  the wife whom choice and passion doth approve,
  sure every wise and worthy man will love.
  nor did my fair one less distinction claim
  slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.
  wrong'd in my love, all proffers i disdain
  deceived for once, i trust not kings again.
  ye have my answer--what remains to do,
  your king, ulysses, may consult with you.
  what needs he the defence this arm can make?
  has he not walls no human force can shake?
  has he not fenced his guarded navy round
  with piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?
  and will not these  the wonders he has done
  repel the rage of priam's single son?
  there was a time  'twas when for greece i fought
  when hector's prowess no such wonders wrought
  he kept the verge of troy, nor dared to wait
  achilles' fury at the scaean gate
  he tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.
  but now those ancient enmities are o'er
  to-morrow we the favouring gods implore
  then shall you see our parting vessels crown'd,
  and hear with oars the hellespont resound.
  the third day hence shall pthia greet our sails,
  if mighty neptune send propitious gales
  pthia to her achilles shall restore
  the wealth he left for this detested shore
  thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,
  the ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass
  my beauteous captives thither i'll convey,
  and all that rests of my unravish'd prey.
  one only valued gift your tyrant gave,
  and that resumed--the fair lyrnessian slave.
  then tell him  loud, that all the greeks may hear,
  and learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear
   for arm'd in impudence, mankind he braves,
  and meditates new cheats on all his slaves
  though shameless as he is, to face these eyes
  is what he dares not  if he dares he dies
  tell him, all terms, all commerce i decline,
  nor share his council, nor his battle join
  for once deceiv'd, was his  but twice were mine,
  no--let the stupid prince, whom jove deprives
  of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives
  his gifts are hateful  kings of such a kind
  stand but as slaves before a noble mind,
  not though he proffer'd all himself possess'd,
  and all his rapine could from others wrest
  not all the golden tides of wealth that crown
  the many-peopled orchomenian town
  not all proud thebes' unrivall'd walls contain,
  the world's great empress on the egyptian plain
   that spreads her conquests o'er a thousand states,
  and pours her heroes through a hundred gates,
  two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars
  from each wide portal issuing to the wars
  though bribes were heap'd on bribes, in number more
  than dust in fields, or sands along the shore
  should all these offers for my friendship call,
  'tis he that offers, and i scorn them all.
  atrides' daughter never shall be led
   an ill-match'd consort  to achilles' bed
  like golden venus though she charm'd the heart,
  and vied with pallas in the works of art
  some greater greek let those high nuptials grace,
  i hate alliance with a tyrant's race.
  if heaven restore me to my realms with life,
  the reverend peleus shall elect my wife
  thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,
  and kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.
  bless'd in kind love, my years shall glide away,
  content with just hereditary sway
  there, deaf for ever to the martial strife,
  enjoy the dear prerogative of life.
  life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.
  not all apollo's pythian treasures hold,
  or troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,
  can bribe the poor possession of a day!
  lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,
  and steeds unrivall'd on the dusty plain
  but from our lips the vital spirit fled,
  returns no more to wake the silent dead.
  my fates long since by thetis were disclosed,
  and each alternate, life or fame, proposed
  here, if i stay, before the trojan town,
  short is my date, but deathless my renown
  if i return, i quit immortal praise
  for years on years, and long-extended days.
  convinced, though late, i find my fond mistake,
  and warn the greeks the wiser choice to make
  to quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,
  nor hope the fall of heaven-defended troy.
  jove's arm display'd asserts her from the skies!
  her hearts are strengthen'd, and her glories rise.
  go then to greece, report our fix'd design
  bid all your counsels, all your armies join,
  let all your forces, all your arts conspire,
  to save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.
  one stratagem has fail'd, and others will
  ye find, achilles is unconquer'd still.
  go then--digest my message as ye may--
  but here this night let reverend phoenix stay
  his tedious toils and hoary hairs demand
  a peaceful death in pthia's friendly land.
  but whether he remain or sail with me,
  his age be sacred, and his will be free.
  the son of peleus ceased  the chiefs around
  in silence wrapt, in consternation drown'd,
  attend the stern reply. then phoenix rose
   down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows
  and while the fate of suffering greece he mourn'd,
  with accent weak these tender words return'd.
   divine achilles! wilt thou then retire,
  and leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?
  if wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,
  how shall thy friend, thy phoenix, stay behind?
  the royal peleus, when from pthia's coast
  he sent thee early to the achaian host
  thy youth as then in sage debates unskill'd,
  and new to perils of the direful field
  he bade me teach thee all the ways of war,
  to shine in councils, and in camps to dare.
  never, ah, never let me leave thy side!
  no time shall part us, and no fate divide,
  not though the god, that breathed my life, restore
  the bloom i boasted, and the port i bore,
  when greece of old beheld my youthful flames
   delightful greece, the land of lovely dames ,
  my father faithless to my mother's arms,
  old as he was, adored a stranger's charms.
  i tried what youth could do  at her desire
  to win the damsel, and prevent my sire.
  my sire with curses loads my hated head,
  and cries, 'ye furies! barren be his bed.'
  infernal jove, the vengeful fiends below,
  and ruthless proserpine, confirm'd his vow.
  despair and grief distract my labouring mind!
  gods! what a crime my impious heart design'd!
  i thought  but some kind god that thought suppress'd
  to plunge the poniard in my father's breast
  then meditate my flight  my friends in vain
  with prayers entreat me, and with force detain.
  on fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,
  they daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine
  strong guards they placed, and watch'd nine nights entire
  the roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.
  the tenth, i forced the gates, unseen of all
  and, favour'd by the night, o'erleap'd the wall,
  my travels thence through spacious greece extend
  in phthia's court at last my labours end.
  your sire received me, as his son caress'd,
  with gifts enrich'd, and with possessions bless'd.
  the strong dolopians thenceforth own'd my reign,
  and all the coast that runs along the main.
  by love to thee his bounties i repaid,
  and early wisdom to thy soul convey'd
  great as thou art, my lessons made thee brave
  a child i took thee, but a hero gave.
  thy infant breast a like affection show'd
  still in my arms  an ever-pleasing load
  or at my knee, by phoenix wouldst thou stand
  no food was grateful but from phoenix' hand.
  i pass my watchings o'er thy helpless years,
  the tender labours, the compliant cares,
  the gods  i thought  reversed their hard decree,
  and phoenix felt a father's joys in thee
  thy growing virtues justified my cares,
  and promised comfort to my silver hairs.
  now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign'd
  a cruel heart ill suits a manly mind
  the gods  the only great, and only wise
  are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice
  offending man their high compassion wins,
  and daily prayers atone for daily sins.
  prayers are jove's daughters, of celestial race,
  lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face
  with humble mien, and with dejected eyes,
  constant they follow, where injustice flies.
  injustice swift, erect, and unconfined,
  sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind,
  while prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.
  who hears these daughters of almighty jove,
  for him they mediate to the throne above
  when man rejects the humble suit they make,
  the sire revenges for the daughters' sake
  from jove commission'd, fierce injustice then
  descends to punish unrelenting men.
  o let not headlong passion bear the sway
  these reconciling goddesses obey
  due honours to the seed of jove belong,
  due honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.
  were these not paid thee by the terms we bring,
  were rage still harbour'd in the haughty king
  nor greece nor all her fortunes should engage
  thy friend to plead against so just a rage.
  but since what honour asks the general sends,
  and sends by those whom most thy heart commends
  the best and noblest of the grecian train
  permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!
  let me  my son  an ancient fact unfold,
  a great example drawn from times of old
  hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,
  who conquer'd their revenge in former days.
   where calydon on rocky mountains stands
  once fought the  tolian and curetian bands
  to guard it those  to conquer, these advance
  and mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.
  the silver cynthia bade contention rise,
  in vengeance of neglected sacrifice
  on oeneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,
  that levell'd harvests, and whole forests tore
  this beast  when many a chief his tusks had slain
  great meleager stretch'd along the plain,
  then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,
  the neighbour nations thence commencing foes.
  strong as they were, the bold curetes fail'd,
  while meleager's thundering arm prevail'd
  till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast
   for rage invades the wisest and the best .
   cursed by althaea, to his wrath he yields,
  and in his wife's embrace forgets the fields.
   she from marpessa sprung, divinely fair,
  and matchless idas, more than man in war
  the god of day adored the mother's charms
  against the god the father bent his arms
  the afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,
  from cleopatra changed their daughter's name,
  and call'd alcyone  a name to show
  the father's grief, the mourning mother's woe.
  to her the chief retired from stern debate,
  but found no peace from fierce althaea's hate
  althaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,
  whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew
  she beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath
  on her own son to wreak her brother's death
  hell heard her curses from the realms profound,
  and the red fiends that walk the nightly round.
  in vain  tolia her deliverer waits,
  war shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.
  she sent ambassadors, a chosen band,
  priests of the gods, and elders of the land
  besought the chief to save the sinking state
  their prayers were urgent, and their proffers great
   full fifty acres of the richest ground,
  half pasture green, and half with vineyards crown'd
  his suppliant father, aged oeneus, came
  his sisters follow'd  even the vengeful dame,
  althaea, sues  his friends before him fall
  he stands relentless, and rejects them all.
  meanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies
  the walls are scaled  the rolling flames arise
  at length his wife  a form divine  appears,
  with piercing cries, and supplicating tears
  she paints the horrors of a conquer'd town,
  the heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown,
  the matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved
  the warrior heard, he vanquish'd, and he saved.
  the  tolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn,
  and left the chief their broken faith to mourn.
  learn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,
  nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire
  accept the presents  draw thy conquering sword
  and be amongst our guardian gods adored.
  thus he  the stern achilles thus replied
   my second father, and my reverend guide
  thy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,
  and asks no honours from a mortal's hands
  jove honours me, and favours my designs
  his pleasure guides me, and his will confines
  and here i stay  if such his high behest
  while life's warm spirit beats within my breast.
  yet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart
  no more molest me on atrides' part
  is it for him these tears are taught to flow,
  for him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?
  a generous friendship no cold medium knows,
  burns with one love, with one resentment glows
  one should our interests and our passions be
  my friend must hate the man that injures me.
  do this, my phoenix, 'tis a generous part
  and share my realms, my honours, and my heart.
  let these return  our voyage, or our stay,
  rest undetermined till the dawning day.
  he ceased  then order'd for the sage's bed
  a warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.
  with that, stern ajax his long silence broke,
  and thus, impatient, to ulysses spoke
   hence let us go--why waste we time in vain?
  see what effect our low submissions gain!
  liked or not liked, his words we must relate,
  the greeks expect them, and our heroes wait.
  proud as he is, that iron heart retains
  its stubborn purpose, and his friends disdains.
  stern and unpitying! if a brother bleed,
  on just atonement, we remit the deed
  a sire the slaughter of his son forgives
  the price of blood discharged, the murderer lives
  the haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign,
  and gifts can conquer every soul but thine.
  the gods that unrelenting breast have steel'd,
  and cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.
  one woman-slave was ravish'd from thy arms
  lo, seven are offer'd, and of equal charms.
  then hear, achilles! be of better mind
  revere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind
  and know the men of all the grecian host,
  who honour worth, and prize thy valour most.
   o soul of battles, and thy people's guide!
   to ajax thus the first of greeks replied
  well hast thou spoke  but at the tyrant's name
  my rage rekindles, and my soul's on flame
  'tis just resentment, and becomes the brave
  disgraced, dishonour'd, like the vilest slave!
  return, then, heroes! and our answer bear,
  the glorious combat is no more my care
  not till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,
  the blood of greeks shall dye the sable main
  not till the flames, by hector's fury thrown,
  consume your vessels, and approach my own
  just there, the impetuous homicide shall stand,
  there cease his battle, and there feel our hand.
  this said, each prince a double goblet crown'd,
  and cast a large libation on the ground
  then to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,
  the chiefs return  divine ulysses leads.
  meantime achilles' slaves prepared a bed,
  with fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread
  there, till the sacred morn restored the day,
  in slumber sweet the reverend phoenix lay.
  but in his inner tent, an ampler space,
  achilles slept  and in his warm embrace
  fair diomede of the lesbian race.
  last, for patroclus was the couch prepared,
  whose nightly joys the beauteous iphis shared
  achilles to his friend consign'd her charms
  when scyros fell before his conquering arms.
  and now the elected chiefs whom greece had sent,
  pass'd through the hosts, and reach'd the royal tent.
  then rising all, with goblets in their hands,
  the peers and leaders of the achaian bands
  hail'd their return  atrides first begun
   say what success? divine laertes' son!
  achilles' high resolves declare to all
   returns the chief, or must our navy fall?
   great king of nations!  ithacus replied
  fix'd is his wrath, unconquer'd is his pride
  he slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,
  and, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.
  to save our army, and our fleets to free,
  is not his care  but left to greece and thee.
  your eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,
  beneath his oars the whitening billows fly
  us too he bids our oars and sails employ,
  nor hope the fall of heaven-protected troy
  for jove o'ershades her with his arm divine,
  inspires her war, and bids her glory shine.
  such was his word  what further he declared,
  these sacred heralds and great ajax heard.
  but phoenix in his tent the chief retains,
  safe to transport him to his native plains
  when morning dawns  if other he decree,
  his age is sacred, and his choice is free.
  ulysses ceased  the great achaian host,
  with sorrow seized, in consternation lost,
  attend the stern reply. tydides broke
  the general silence, and undaunted spoke.
   why should we gifts to proud achilles send,
  or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?
  his country's woes he glories to deride,
  and prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.
  be the fierce impulse of his rage obey'd,
  our battles let him or desert or aid
  then let him arm when jove or he think fit
  that, to his madness, or to heaven commit
  what for ourselves we can, is always ours
  this night, let due repast refresh our powers
   for strength consists in spirits and in blood,
  and those are owed to generous wine and food
  but when the rosy messenger of day
  strikes the blue mountains with her golden ray,
  ranged at the ships, let all our squadrons shine
  in flaming arms, a long-extended line
  in the dread front let great atrides stand,
  the first in danger, as in high command.
  shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise,
  then each to heaven the due libations pays
  till sleep, descending o'er the tents, bestows
  the grateful blessings of desired repose.
  all night the chiefs before their vessels lay,
  and lost in sleep the labours of the day
  all but the king  with various thoughts oppress'd,
  his country's cares lay rolling in his breast.
  as when by lightnings jove's ethereal power
  foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,
  or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,
  or bids the brazen throat of war to roar
  by fits one flash succeeds as one expires,
  and heaven flames thick with momentary fires
  so bursting frequent from atrides' breast,
  sighs following sighs his inward fears confess'd.
  now o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys
  from thousand trojan fires the mounting blaze
  hears in the passing wind their music blow,
  and marks distinct the voices of the foe.
  now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,
  anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.
  he rends his hair, in sacrifice to jove,
  and sues to him that ever lives above
  inly he groans  while glory and despair
  divide his heart, and wage a double war.
  a thousand cares his labouring breast revolves
  to seek sage nestor now the chief resolves,
  with him, in wholesome counsels, to debate
  what yet remains to save the afflicted state.
  he rose, and first he cast his mantle round,
  next on his feet the shining sandals bound
  a lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd
  his warlike hand a pointed javelin held.
  meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes,
  alike denied the gifts of soft repose,
  laments for greece, that in his cause before
  so much had suffer'd and must suffer more.
  a leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread
  a brazen helmet glitter'd on his head
  thus  with a javelin in his hand  he went
  to wake atrides in the royal tent.
  already waked, atrides he descried,
  his armour buckling at his vessel's side.
  joyful they met  the spartan thus begun
   why puts my brother his bright armour on?
  sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,
  to try yon camp, and watch the trojan powers?
  but say, what hero shall sustain that task?
  such bold exploits uncommon courage ask
  guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,
  and midst a hostile camp explore the foe.
  to whom the king   in such distress we stand,
  no vulgar counsel our affairs demand
  greece to preserve, is now no easy part,
  but asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.
  for jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,
  and bows his head to hector's sacrifice.
  what eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,
  in one great day, by one great arm achieved,
  such wondrous deeds as hector's hand has done,
  and we beheld, the last revolving sun
  what honours the beloved of jove adorn!
  sprung from no god, and of no goddess born
  yet such his acts, as greeks unborn shall tell,
  and curse the battle where their fathers fell.
   now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,
  there call great ajax, and the prince of crete
  ourself to hoary nestor will repair
  to keep the guards on duty be his care,
   for nestor's influence best that quarter guides,
  whose son with merion, o'er the watch presides.
  to whom the spartan   these thy orders borne,
  say, shall i stay, or with despatch return?
   there shall thou stay,  the king of men replied,
  else may we miss to meet, without a guide,
  the paths so many, and the camp so wide.
  still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,
  urge by their fathers' fame their future praise.
  forget we now our state and lofty birth
  not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.
  to labour is the lot of man below
  and when jove gave us life, he gave us woe.
  this said, each parted to his several cares
  the king to nestor's sable ship repairs
  the sage protector of the greeks he found
  stretch'd in his bed with all his arms around
  the various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,
  the shining helmet, and the pointed spears
  the dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,
  that, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.
  then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,
  the hoary monarch raised his eyes and said
   what art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,
  while others sleep, thus range the camp alone
  seek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?
  stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.
   o son of neleus,  thus the king rejoin'd,
  pride of the greeks, and glory of thy kind!
  lo, here the wretched agamemnon stands,
  the unhappy general of the grecian bands,
  whom jove decrees with daily cares to bend,
  and woes, that only with his life shall end!
  scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,
  and scarce my heart support its load of pain.
  no taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,
  confused, and sad, i wander thus alone,
  with fears distracted, with no fix'd design
  and all my people's miseries are mine.
  if aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,
   since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,
  impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend
  now let us jointly to the trench descend,
  at every gate the fainting guard excite,
  tired with the toils of day and watch of night
  else may the sudden foe our works invade,
  so near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade.
  to him thus nestor   trust the powers above,
  nor think proud hector's hopes confirm'd by jove
  how ill agree the views of vain mankind,
  and the wise counsels of the eternal mind!
  audacious hector, if the gods ordain
  that great achilles rise and rage again,
  what toils attend thee, and what woes remain!
  lo, faithful nestor thy command obeys
  the care is next our other chiefs to raise
  ulysses, diomed, we chiefly need
  meges for strength, oileus famed for speed.
  some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,
  to those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,
  where lie great ajax and the king of crete.
  to rouse the spartan i myself decree
  dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,
  yet must i tax his sloth, that claims no share
  with his great brother in his martial care
  him it behoved to every chief to sue,
  preventing every part perform'd by you
  for strong necessity our toils demands,
  claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.
  to whom the king   with reverence we allow
  thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now
  my generous brother is of gentle kind,
  he seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind
  through too much deference to our sovereign sway,
  content to follow when we lead the way
  but now, our ills industrious to prevent,
  long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.
  the chiefs you named, already at his call,
  prepare to meet us near the navy-wall
  assembling there, between the trench and gates,
  near the night-guards, our chosen council waits.
   then none  said nestor  shall his rule withstand,
  for great examples justify command.
  with that, the venerable warrior rose
  the shining greaves his manly legs enclose
  his purple mantle golden buckles join'd,
  warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.
  then rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste
  his steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.
  the camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,
  stopp'd at ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.
  ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,
  awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.
   what new distress, what sudden cause of fright,
  thus leads you wandering in the silent night?
   o prudent chief!  the pylian sage replied
  wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried
  whatever means of safety can be sought,
  whatever counsels can inspire our thought,
  whatever methods, or to fly or fight
  all, all depend on this important night!
  he heard, return'd, and took his painted shield
  then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.
  without his tent, bold diomed they found,
  all sheathed in arms, his brave companions round
  each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,
  his head reclining on his bossy shield.
  a wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,
  shot from their flashing points a quivering light.
  a bull's black hide composed the hero's bed
  a splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.
  then, with his foot, old nestor gently shakes
  the slumbering chief, and in these words awakes
   rise, son of tydeus! to the brave and strong
  rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.
  but sleep'st thou now, when from yon hill the foe
  hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?
  at this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled
  the warrior saw the hoary chief, and said
   wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,
  though years and honours bid thee seek repose,
  let younger greeks our sleeping warriors wake
  ill fits thy age these toils to undertake.
   my friend,  he answered,  generous is thy care
  these toils, my subjects and my sons might bear
  their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire
  to ease a sovereign and relieve a sire
  but now the last despair surrounds our host
  no hour must pass, no moment must be lost
  each single greek, in this conclusive strife,
  stands on the sharpest edge of death or life
  yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,
  employ thy youth as i employ my age
  succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest
  he serves me most, who serves his country best.
  this said, the hero o'er his shoulders flung
  a lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung
  then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.
  meges the bold, with ajax famed for speed,
  the warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.
  and now the chiefs approach the nightly guard
  a wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared
  the unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,
  and, couching close, repel invading sleep.
  so faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,
  with toil protected from the prowling train
  when the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,
  springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold
  through breaking woods her rustling course they hear
  loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear
  of hounds and men  they start, they gaze around,
  watch every side, and turn to every sound.
  thus watch'd the grecians, cautious of surprise,
  each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes
  each step of passing feet increased the affright
  and hostile troy was ever full in sight.
  nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,
  and thus accosted through the gloomy shade.
   'tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ
  else must our host become the scorn of troy.
  watch thus, and greece shall live.  the hero said
  then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.
  his son, and godlike merion, march'd behind
   for these the princes to their council join'd .
  the trenches pass'd, the assembled kings around
  in silent state the consistory crown'd.
  a place there was, yet undefiled with gore,
  the spot where hector stopp'd his rage before
  when night descending, from his vengeful hand
  reprieved the relics of the grecian band
   the plain beside with mangled corps was spread,
  and all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead
  there sat the mournful kings  when neleus' son,
  the council opening, in these words begun
   is there  said he  a chief so greatly brave,
  his life to hazard, and his country save?
  lives there a man, who singly dares to go
  to yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?
  or favour'd by the night approach so near,
  their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?
  if to besiege our navies they prepare,
  or troy once more must be the seat of war?
  this could he learn, and to our peers recite,
  and pass unharm'd the dangers of the night
  what fame were his through all succeeding days,
  while phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!
  what gifts his grateful country would bestow!
  what must not greece to her deliverer owe?
  a sable ewe each leader should provide,
  with each a sable lambkin by her side
  at every rite his share should be increased,
  and his the foremost honours of the feast.
  fear held them mute  alone, untaught to fear,
  tydides spoke-- the man you seek is here.
  through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,
  some god within commands, and i obey.
  but let some other chosen warrior join,
  to raise my hopes, and second my design.
  by mutual confidence and mutual aid,
  great deeds are done, and great discoveries made
  the wise new prudence from the wise acquire,
  and one brave hero fans another's fire.
  contending leaders at the word arose
  each generous breast with emulation glows
  so brave a task each ajax strove to share,
  bold merion strove, and nestor's valiant heir
  the spartan wish'd the second place to gain,
  and great ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.
  then thus the king of men the contest ends
   thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,
  undaunted diomed! what chief to join
  in this great enterprise, is only thine.
  just be thy choice, without affection made
  to birth, or office, no respect be paid
  let worth determine here.  the monarch spake,
  and inly trembled for his brother's sake.
   then thus  the godlike diomed rejoin'd
  my choice declares the impulse of my mind.
  how can i doubt, while great ulysses stands
  to lend his counsels and assist our hands?
  a chief, whose safety is minerva's care
  so famed, so dreadful, in the works of war
  bless'd in his conduct, i no aid require
  wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.
   it fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,
   replied the sage,  to praise me, or to blame
  praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,
  are lost on hearers that our merits know.
  but let us haste--night rolls the hours away,
  the reddening orient shows the coming day,
  the stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,
  and of night's empire but a third remains.
  thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,
  in arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.
  a two-edged falchion thrasymed the brave,
  and ample buckler, to tydides gave
  then in a leathern helm he cased his head,
  short of its crest, and with no plume o'erspread
   such as by youths unused to arms are worn
  no spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.
  next him ulysses took a shining sword,
  a bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored
  a well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,
   thy gift, meriones,  his temples crown'd
  soft wool within  without, in order spread,
  a boar's white teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head.
  this from amyntor, rich ormenus' son,
  autolycus by fraudful rapine won,
  and gave amphidamas  from him the prize
  molus received, the pledge of social ties
  the helmet next by merion was possess'd,
  and now ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.
  thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,
  and dark through paths oblique their progress take.
  just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,
  a long-wing'd heron great minerva sent
  this, though surrounding shades obscured their view.
  by the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.
  as from the right she soar'd, ulysses pray'd,
  hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid
   o daughter of that god whose arm can wield
  the avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!
  o thou! for ever present in my way,
  who all my motions, all my toils survey!
  safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,
  safe by thy succour to our ships convey'd,
  and let some deed this signal night adorn,
  to claim the tears of trojans yet unborn.
  then godlike diomed preferr'd his prayer
   daughter of jove, unconquer'd pallas! hear.
  great queen of arms, whose favour tydeus won,
  as thou defend'st the sire, defend the son.
  when on  sopus' banks the banded powers
  of greece he left, and sought the theban towers,
  peace was his charge  received with peaceful show,
  he went a legate, but return'd a foe
  then help'd by thee, and cover'd by thy shield,
  he fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.
  so now be present, o celestial maid!
  so still continue to the race thine aid!
  a youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,
  untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,
  with ample forehead, and with spreading horns,
  whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns.
  the heroes pray'd, and pallas from the skies
  accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.
  now, like two lions panting for the prey,
  with dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,
  through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,
  through dust, through blood, o'er arms, and hills of slain.
  nor less bold hector, and the sons of troy,
  on high designs the wakeful hours employ
  the assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed
  who thus the counsels of his breast proposed
   what glorious man, for high attempts prepared,
  dares greatly venture for a rich reward?
  of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,
  what watch they keep, and what resolves they take?
  if now subdued they meditate their flight,
  and, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?
  his be the chariot that shall please him most,
  of all the plunder of the vanquish'd host
  his the fair steeds that all the rest excel,
  and his the glory to have served so well.
  a youth there was among the tribes of troy,
  dolon his name, eumedes' only boy,
   five girls beside the reverend herald told.
  rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold
  not bless'd by nature with the charms of face,
  but swift of foot, and matchless in the race.
   hector!  he said  my courage bids me meet
  this high achievement, and explore the fleet
  but first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,
  and swear to grant me the demanded prize
  the immortal coursers, and the glittering car,
  that bear pelides through the ranks of war.
  encouraged thus, no idle scout i go,
  fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,
  even to the royal tent pursue my way,
  and all their counsels, all their aims betray.
  the chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,
  attesting thus the monarch of the sky
   be witness thou! immortal lord of all!
  whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall
  by none but dolon shall this prize be borne,
  and him alone the immortal steeds adorn.
  thus hector swore  the gods were call'd in vain,
  but the rash youth prepares to scour the plain
  across his back the bended bow he flung,
  a wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,
  a ferret's downy fur his helmet lined,
  and in his hand a pointed javelin shined.
  then  never to return  he sought the shore,
  and trod the path his feet must tread no more.
  scarce had he pass'd the steeds and trojan throng,
   still bending forward as he coursed along,
  when, on the hollow way, the approaching tread
  ulysses mark'd, and thus to diomed
   o friend! i hear some step of hostile feet,
  moving this way, or hastening to the fleet
  some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main
  or nightly pillager that strips the slain.
  yet let him pass, and win a little space
  then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.
  but if too swift of foot he flies before,
  confine his course along the fleet and shore,
  betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,
  and intercept his hoped return to troy.
  with that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,
   as dolon pass'd,  behind a heap of dead
  along the path the spy unwary flew
  soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.
  so distant they, and such the space between,
  as when two teams of mules divide the green,
   to whom the hind like shares of land allows,
  when now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.
  now dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd
  hector  he thought  had sent, and check'd his haste,
  till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,
  no voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.
  as when two skilful hounds the leveret wind
  or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind
  now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,
  and from the herd still turn the flying prey
  so fast, and with such fears, the trojan flew
  so close, so constant, the bold greeks pursue.
  now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,
  and mingles with the guards that watch the walls
  when brave tydides stopp'd  a gen'rous thought
   inspired by pallas  in his bosom wrought,
  lest on the foe some forward greek advance,
  and snatch the glory from his lifted lance.
  then thus aloud   whoe'er thou art, remain
  this javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.
  he said, and high in air the weapon cast,
  which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd
  then fix'd in earth. against the trembling wood
  the wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood
  a sudden palsy seized his turning head
  his loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled
  the panting warriors seize him as he stands,
  and with unmanly tears his life demands.
   o spare my youth, and for the breath i owe,
  large gifts of price my father shall bestow
  vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,
  and steel well-temper'd and refulgent gold.
  to whom ulysses made this wise reply
   whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.
  what moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,
  to roam the silent fields in dead of night?
  cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find,
  by hector prompted, or thy daring mind?
  or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,
  through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?
  then thus pale dolon, with a fearful look
   still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook
   hither i came, by hector's words deceived
  much did he promise, rashly i believed
  no less a bribe than great achilles' car,
  and those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,
  urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make
  to learn what counsels, what resolves you take
  if now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,
  and, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night.
   bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,
   ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,
  far other rulers those proud steeds demand,
  and scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand
  even great achilles scarce their rage can tame,
  achilles sprung from an immortal dame.
  but say, be faithful, and the truth recite!
  where lies encamp'd the trojan chief to-night?
  where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep
  their other princes? tell what watch they keep
  say, since this conquest, what their counsels are
  or here to combat, from their city far,
  or back to ilion's walls transfer the war?
  ulysses thus, and thus eumedes' son
   what dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.
  hector, the peers assembling in his tent,
  a council holds at ilus' monument.
  no certain guards the nightly watch partake
  where'er yon fires ascend, the trojans wake
  anxious for troy, the guard the natives keep
  safe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,
  whose wives and infants, from the danger far,
  discharge their souls of half the fears of war.
   then sleep those aids among the trojan train,
   inquired the chief,  or scattered o'er the plain?
  to whom the spy   their powers they thus dispose
  the paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,
  the carians, caucons, the pelasgian host,
  and leleges, encamp along the coast.
  not distant far, lie higher on the land
  the lycian, mysian, and maeonian band,
  and phrygia's horse, by thymbras' ancient wall
  the thracians utmost, and apart from all.
  these troy but lately to her succour won,
  led on by rhesus, great eioneus' son
  i saw his coursers in proud triumph go,
  swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow
  rich silver plates his shining car infold
  his solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold
  no mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,
  celestial panoply, to grace a god!
  let me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,
  or leave me here, a captive's fate to mourn,
  in cruel chains, till your return reveal
  the truth or falsehood of the news i tell.
  to this tydides, with a gloomy frown
   think not to live, though all the truth be shown
  shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife
  to risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?
  or that again our camps thou may'st explore?
  no--once a traitor, thou betray'st no more.
  sternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared
  with humble blandishment to stroke his beard,
  like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,
  divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two
  one instant snatch'd his trembling soul to hell,
  the head, yet speaking, mutter'd as it fell.
  the furry helmet from his brow they tear,
  the wolf's grey hide, the unbended bow and spear
  these great ulysses lifting to the skies,
  to favouring pallas dedicates the prize
   great queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,
  and let the thracian steeds reward our toil
  thee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise
  o speed our labours, and direct our ways!
  this said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,
  high on a spreading tamarisk he placed
  then heap'd with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,
  to guide their footsteps to the place again.
  through the still night they cross the devious fields,
  slippery with blood, o'er arms and heaps of shields,
  arriving where the thracian squadrons lay,
  and eased in sleep the labours of the day.
  ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band
  the horses yoked beside each warrior stand.
  their arms in order on the ground reclined,
  through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined
  amidst lay rhesus, stretch'd in sleep profound,
  and the white steeds behind his chariot bound.
  the welcome sight ulysses first descries,
  and points to diomed the tempting prize.
   the man, the coursers, and the car behold!
  described by dolon, with the arms of gold.
  now, brave tydides! now thy courage try,
  approach the chariot, and the steeds untie
  or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds,
  urge thou the slaughter, while i seize the steeds.
  pallas  this said  her hero's bosom warms,
  breathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms
  where'er he pass'd, a purple stream pursued
  his thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,
  bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,
  and a low groan remurmur'd through the shore.
  so the grim lion, from his nightly den,
  o'erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,
  on sheep or goats, resistless in his way,
  he falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey
  nor stopp'd the fury of his vengeful hand,
  till twelve lay breathless of the thracian band.
  ulysses following, as his partner slew,
  back by the foot each slaughter'd warrior drew
  the milk-white coursers studious to convey
  safe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way
  lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,
  should start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.
  now twelve despatch'd, the monarch last they found
  tydides' falchion fix'd him to the ground.
  just then a deathful dream minerva sent,
  a warlike form appear'd before his tent,
  whose visionary steel his bosom tore
  so dream'd the monarch, and awaked no more.
  ulysses now the snowy steeds detains,
  and leads them, fasten'd by the silver reins
  these, with his bow unbent, he lash'd along
   the scourge forgot, on rhesus' chariot hung
  then gave his friend the signal to retire
  but him, new dangers, new achievements fire
  doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade
  to send more heroes to the infernal shade,
  drag off the car where rhesus' armour lay,
  or heave with manly force, and lift away.
  while unresolved the son of tydeus stands,
  pallas appears, and thus her chief commands
   enough, my son  from further slaughter cease,
  regard thy safety, and depart in peace
  haste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy,
  nor tempt too far the hostile gods of troy.
  the voice divine confess'd the martial maid
  in haste he mounted, and her word obey'd
  the coursers fly before ulysses' bow,
  swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow.
  not unobserved they pass'd  the god of light
  had watch'd his troy, and mark'd minerva's flight,
  saw tydeus' son with heavenly succour bless'd,
  and vengeful anger fill'd his sacred breast.
  swift to the trojan camp descends the power,
  and wakes hippocoon in the morning-hour
   on rhesus' side accustom'd to attend,
  a faithful kinsman, and instructive friend
  he rose, and saw the field deform'd with blood,
  an empty space where late the coursers stood,
  the yet-warm thracians panting on the coast
  for each he wept, but for his rhesus most
  now while on rhesus' name he calls in vain,
  the gathering tumult spreads o'er all the plain
  on heaps the trojans rush, with wild affright,
  and wondering view the slaughters of the night.
  meanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade
  where late the spoils of hector's spy were laid,
  ulysses stopp'd  to him tydides bore
  the trophy, dropping yet with dolon's gore
  then mounts again  again their nimbler feet
  the coursers ply, and thunder towards the fleet.
  old nestor first perceived the approaching sound,
  bespeaking thus the grecian peers around
   methinks the noise of trampling steeds i hear,
  thickening this way, and gathering on my ear
  perhaps some horses of the trojan breed
   so may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed
  the great tydides and ulysses bear,
  return'd triumphant with this prize of war.
  yet much i fear  ah, may that fear be vain!
  the chiefs outnumber'd by the trojan train
  perhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore
  or, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more.
  scarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,
  and spring to earth  the greeks dismiss their fear
  with words of friendship and extended hands
  they greet the kings  and nestor first demands
   say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,
  thou living glory of the grecian name!
  say whence these coursers? by what chance bestow'd,
  the spoil of foes, or present of a god?
  not those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,
  that draw the burning chariot of the day.
  old as i am, to age i scorn to yield,
  and daily mingle in the martial field
  but sure till now no coursers struck my sight
  like these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.
  some god, i deem, conferred the glorious prize,
  bless'd as ye are, and favourites of the skies
  the care of him who bids the thunder roar,
  and her, whose fury bathes the world with gore.
   father! not so,  sage ithacus rejoin'd,
  the gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.
  of thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,
  whose hostile king the brave tydides slew
  sleeping he died, with all his guards around,
  and twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.
  these other spoils from conquer'd dolon came,
  a wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame
  by hector sent our forces to explore,
  he now lies headless on the sandy shore.
  then o'er the trench the bounding coursers flew
  the joyful greeks with loud acclaim pursue.
  straight to tydides' high pavilion borne,
  the matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn
  the neighing coursers their new fellows greet,
  and the full racks are heap'd with generous wheat.
  but dolon's armour, to his ships convey'd,
  high on the painted stern ulysses laid,
  a trophy destin'd to the blue-eyed maid.
  now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain
  they cleanse their bodies in the neighb'ring main
  then in the polished bath, refresh'd from toil,
  their joints they supple with dissolving oil,
  in due repast indulge the genial hour,
  and first to pallas the libations pour
  they sit, rejoicing in her aid divine,
  and the crown'd goblet foams with floods of wine.
book xi.
argument
the third battle, and the acts of agamemnon.
agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the grecians to battle  hector
prepares the trojans to receive them, while jupiter, juno, and minerva
give the signals of war. agamemnon bears all before him and hector is
commanded by jupiter  who sends iris for that purpose  to decline the
engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field. he
then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. ulysses and diomed put a stop
to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by paris, is obliged to
desert his companion, who is encompassed by the trojans, wounded, and in
the utmost danger, till menelaus and ajax rescue him. hector comes against
ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and rallies the greeks. in
the meantime machaon, in the other wing of the army, is pierced with an
arrow by paris, and carried from the fight in nestor's chariot. achilles
 who overlooked the action from his ship  sent patroclus to inquire which
of the greeks was wounded in that manner  nestor entertains him in his
tent with an account of the accidents of the day, and a long recital of
some former wars which he remembered, tending to put patroclus upon
persuading achilles to fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him
to do it, clad in achilles' armour. patroclus, on his return, meets
eurypylus also wounded, and assists him in that distress.
this book opens with the eight and-twentieth day of the poem, and the same
day, with its various actions and adventures is extended through the
twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and
part of the eighteenth books. the scene lies in the field near the
monument of ilus.
  the saffron morn, with early blushes spread,
  now rose refulgent from tithonus' bed
  with new-born day to gladden mortal sight,
  and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light
  when baleful eris, sent by jove's command,
  the torch of discord blazing in her hand,
  through the red skies her bloody sign extends,
  and, wrapt in tempests, o'er the fleet descends.
  high on ulysses' bark her horrid stand
  she took, and thunder'd through the seas and land.
  even ajax and achilles heard the sound,
  whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,
  thence the black fury through the grecian throng
  with horror sounds the loud orthian song
  the navy shakes, and at the dire alarms
  each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.
  no more they sigh, inglorious to return,
  but breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.
  the king of men his hardy host inspires
  with loud command, with great example fires!
  himself first rose, himself before the rest
  his mighty limbs in radiant armour dress'd,
  and first he cased his manly legs around
  in shining greaves with silver buckles bound
  the beaming cuirass next adorn'd his breast,
  the same which once king cinyras possess'd
   the fame of greece and her assembled host
  had reach'd that monarch on the cyprian coast
  'twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,
  this glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain
  ten rows of azure steel the work infold,
  twice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold
  three glittering dragons to the gorget rise,
  whose imitated scales against the skies
  reflected various light, and arching bow'd,
  like colour'd rainbows o'er a showery cloud
   jove's wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,
  placed as a sign to man amidst the skies .
  a radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,
  sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side
  gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased
  the shining blade, and golden hangers graced.
  his buckler's mighty orb was next display'd,
  that round the warrior cast a dreadful shade
  ten zones of brass its ample brim surround,
  and twice ten bosses the bright convex crown'd
  tremendous gorgon frown'd upon its field,
  and circling terrors fill'd the expressive shield
  within its concave hung a silver thong,
  on which a mimic serpent creeps along,
  his azure length in easy waves extends,
  till in three heads the embroider'd monster ends.
  last o'er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,
  with nodding horse-hair formidably graced
  and in his hands two steely javelins wields,
  that blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.
  that instant juno, and the martial maid,
  in happy thunders promised greece their aid
  high o'er the chief they clash'd their arms in air,
  and, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.
  close to the limits of the trench and mound,
  the fiery coursers to their chariots bound
  the squires restrain'd  the foot, with those who wield
  the lighter arms, rush forward to the field.
  to second these, in close array combined,
  the squadrons spread their sable wings behind.
  now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,
  as with the light the warriors' toils begun.
  even jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill'd
  red drops of blood o'er all the fatal field
  the woes of men unwilling to survey,
  and all the slaughters that must stain the day.
  near ilus' tomb, in order ranged around,
  the trojan lines possess'd the rising ground
  there wise polydamas and hector stood
   neas, honour'd as a guardian god
  bold polybus, agenor the divine
  the brother-warriors of antenor's line
  with youthful acamas, whose beauteous face
  and fair proportion match'd the ethereal race.
  great hector, cover'd with his spacious shield,
  plies all the troops, and orders all the field.
  as the red star now shows his sanguine fires
  through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,
  thus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man,
  plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van
  while streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,
  flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.
  as sweating reapers in some wealthy field,
  ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,
  bear down the furrows, till their labours meet
  thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet
  so greece and troy the field of war divide,
  and falling ranks are strow'd on every side.
  none stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight
  but horse to horse, and man to man they fight,
  not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey
  each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.
  discord with joy the scene of death descries,
  and drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes
  discord alone, of all the immortal train,
  swells the red horrors of this direful plain
  the gods in peace their golden mansions fill,
  ranged in bright order on the olympian hill
  but general murmurs told their griefs above,
  and each accused the partial will of jove.
  meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,
  the eternal monarch, on his awful throne,
  wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate
  and fix'd, fulfill'd the just decrees of fate.
  on earth he turn'd his all-considering eyes,
  and mark'd the spot where ilion's towers arise
  the sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,
  the victor's rage, the dying, and the dead.
  thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,
  o'er heaven's pure azure spread the glowing light,
  commutual death the fate of war confounds,
  each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
  but now  what time in some sequester'd vale
  the weary woodman spreads his sparing meal,
  when his tired arms refuse the axe to rear,
  and claim a respite from the sylvan war
  but not till half the prostrate forests lay
  stretch'd in long ruin, and exposed to day
  then, nor till then, the greeks' impulsive might
  pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.
  great agamemnon then the slaughter led,
  and slew bienor at his people's head
  whose squire oileus, with a sudden spring,
  leap'd from the chariot to revenge his king
  but in his front he felt the fatal wound,
  which pierced his brain, and stretch'd him on the ground.
  atrides spoil'd, and left them on the plain
  vain was their youth, their glittering armour vain
  now soil'd with dust, and naked to the sky,
  their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.
  two sons of priam next to battle move,
  the product, one of marriage, one of love
  in the same car the brother-warriors ride
  this took the charge to combat, that to guide
  far other task, than when they wont to keep,
  on ida's tops, their father's fleecy sheep.
  these on the mountains once achilles found,
  and captive led, with pliant osiers bound
  then to their sire for ample sums restored
  but now to perish by atrides' sword
  pierced in the breast the base-born isus bleeds
  cleft through the head his brother's fate succeeds,
  swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,
  and, stript, their features to his mind recalls.
  the trojans see the youths untimely die,
  but helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.
  so when a lion ranging o'er the lawns.
  finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,
  their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,
  and grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws
  the frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,
  but swift through rustling thickets bursts her way
  all drown'd in sweat, the panting mother flies,
  and the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.
  amidst the tumult of the routed train,
  the sons of false antimachus were slain
  he who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,
  and voted helen's stay for paris' gold.
  atrides mark'd, as these their safety sought,
  and slew the children for the father's fault
  their headstrong horse unable to restrain,
  they shook with fear, and dropp'd the silken rein
  then in the chariot on their knees they fall,
  and thus with lifted hands for mercy call
   o spare our youth, and for the life we owe,
  antimachus shall copious gifts bestow
  soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,
  the grecian ships his captive sons detain,
  large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,
  and steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.
  these words, attended with the flood of tears,
  the youths address'd to unrelenting ears
  the vengeful monarch gave this stern reply
   if from antimachus ye spring, ye die
  the daring wretch who once in council stood
  to shed ulysses' and my brother's blood,
  for proffer'd peace! and sues his seed for grace?
  no, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.
  this said, pisander from the car he cast,
  and pierced his breast  supine he breathed his last.
  his brother leap'd to earth  but, as he lay,
  the trenchant falchion lopp'd his hands away
  his sever'd head was toss'd among the throng,
  and, rolling, drew a bloody train along.
  then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew
  the king's example all his greeks pursue.
  now by the foot the flying foot were slain,
  horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.
  from the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,
  shade the black host, and intercept the skies.
  the brass-hoof'd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,
  and the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,
  still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds
  the distanced army wonders at his deeds,
  as when the winds with raging flames conspire,
  and o'er the forests roll the flood of fire,
  in blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall,
  and one refulgent ruin levels all
  before atrides' rage so sinks the foe,
  whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.
  the steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,
  and many a car, now lighted of its lord,
  wide o'er the field with guideless fury rolls,
  breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls
  while his keen falchion drinks the warriors' lives
  more grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!
  perhaps great hector then had found his fate,
  but jove and destiny prolong'd his date.
  safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,
  amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.
  now past the tomb where ancient ilus lay,
  through the mid field the routed urge their way
  where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,
  the path they take, and speed to reach the town.
  as swift, atrides with loud shouts pursued,
  hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.
  now near the beech-tree, and the scaean gates,
  the hero halts, and his associates waits.
  meanwhile on every side around the plain,
  dispersed, disorder'd, fly the trojan train.
  so flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd
  the lion's roaring through the midnight shade
  on heaps they tumble with successless haste
  the savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.
  not with less fury stern atrides flew,
  still press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew
  hurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd,
  and rage, and death, and carnage load the field.
  now storms the victor at the trojan wall
  surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.
  but jove descending shook the idaean hills,
  and down their summits pour'd a hundred rills
  the unkindled lightning in his hand he took,
  and thus the many-coloured maid bespoke
   iris, with haste thy golden wings display,
  to godlike hector this our word convey--
  while agamemnon wastes the ranks around,
  fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,
  bid him give way  but issue forth commands,
  and trust the war to less important hands
  but when, or wounded by the spear or dart,
  that chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,
  then jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,
  then to her ships shall flying greece be press'd,
  till to the main the burning sun descend,
  and sacred night her awful shade extend.
  he spoke, and iris at his word obey'd
  on wings of winds descends the various maid.
  the chief she found amidst the ranks of war,
  close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.
  the goddess then   o son of priam, hear!
  from jove i come, and his high mandate bear.
  while agamemnon wastes the ranks around,
  fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,
  abstain from fight  yet issue forth commands,
  and trust the war to less important hands
  but when, or wounded by the spear or dart,
  the chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,
  then jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,
  then to her ships shall flying greece be press'd,
  till to the main the burning sun descend,
  and sacred night her awful shade extend.
  she said, and vanish'd. hector, with a bound,
  springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,
  in clanging arms  he grasps in either hand
  a pointed lance, and speeds from band to band
  revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,
  and wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
  they stand to arms  the greeks their onset dare,
  condense their powers, and wait the coming war.
  new force, new spirit, to each breast returns
  the fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns
  the king leads on  all fix on him their eye,
  and learn from him to conquer, or to die.
  ye sacred nine! celestial muses! tell,
  who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?
  the great iphidamas, the bold and young,
  from sage antenor and theano sprung
  whom from his youth his grandsire cisseus bred,
  and nursed in thrace where snowy flocks are fed.
  scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,
  and early honour warm his generous breast,
  when the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms
   theano's sister  to his youthful arms.
  but call'd by glory to the wars of troy,
  he leaves untasted the first fruits of joy
  from his loved bride departs with melting eyes,
  and swift to aid his dearer country flies.
  with twelve black ships he reach'd percope's strand,
  thence took the long laborious march by land.
  now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,
  towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.
  atrides first discharged the missive spear
  the trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air.
  then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart,
  with all his strength, the youth directs his dart
  but the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,
  the point rebated, and repell'd the wound.
  encumber'd with the dart, atrides stands,
  till, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands
  at once his weighty sword discharged a wound
  full on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground.
  stretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,
  and sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.
  oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!
  thy country's friend  and virtuous, though in vain!
  no more the youth shall join his consort's side,
  at once a virgin, and at once a bride!
  no more with presents her embraces meet,
  or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,
  on whom his passion, lavish of his store,
  bestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!
  unwept, uncover'd, on the plain he lay,
  while the proud victor bore his arms away.
  coon, antenor's eldest hope, was nigh
  tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,
  while pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view'd,
  and the pale features now deform'd with blood.
  then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,
  aim'd at the king, and near his elbow strook.
  the thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,
  and through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.
  surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear
  on coon rushes with his lifted spear
  his brother's corpse the pious trojan draws,
  and calls his country to assert his cause
  defends him breathless on the sanguine field,
  and o'er the body spreads his ample shield.
  atrides, marking an unguarded part,
  transfix'd the warrior with his brazen dart
  prone on his brother's bleeding breast he lay,
  the monarch's falchion lopp'd his head away
  the social shades the same dark journey go,
  and join each other in the realms below.
  the vengeful victor rages round the fields,
  with every weapon art or fury yields
  by the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,
  whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.
  this, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood
  but when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,
  then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,
  less keen those darts the fierce ilythiae send
   the powers that cause the teeming matron's throes,
  sad mothers of unutterable woes!
  stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,
  he mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein
  then with a voice which fury made more strong,
  and pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng
   o friends! o greeks! assert your honours won
  proceed, and finish what this arm begun
  lo! angry jove forbids your chief to stay,
  and envies half the glories of the day.
  he said  the driver whirls his lengthful thong
  the horses fly  the chariot smokes along.
  clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,
  and from their sides the foam descends in snow
  shot through the battle in a moment's space,
  the wounded monarch at his tent they place.
  no sooner hector saw the king retired,
  but thus his trojans and his aids he fired
   hear, all ye dardan, all ye lycian race!
  famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face
  now call to mind your ancient trophies won,
  your great forefathers' virtues, and your own.
  behold, the general flies! deserts his powers!
  lo, jove himself declares the conquest ours!
  now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds
  and, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds.
  with words like these the fiery chief alarms
  his fainting host, and every bosom warms.
  as the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear
  the brindled lion, or the tusky bear
  with voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,
  and springs the foremost with his lifted dart
  so godlike hector prompts his troops to dare
  nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.
  on the black body of the foe he pours
  as from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers,
  a sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,
  drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.
  say, muse! when jove the trojan's glory crown'd,
  beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?
  assaeus, dolops, and autonous died,
  opites next was added to their side
  then brave hipponous, famed in many a fight,
  opheltius, orus, sunk to endless night
   symnus, agelaus  all chiefs of name
  the rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.
  as when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,
  dispels the gather'd clouds that notus forms
  the gust continued, violent and strong,
  rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along
  now to the skies the foaming billows rears,
  now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares
  thus, raging hector, with resistless hands,
  o'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.
  now the last ruin the whole host appals
  now greece had trembled in her wooden walls
  but wise ulysses call'd tydides forth,
  his soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.
   and stand we deedless, o eternal shame!
  till hector's arm involve the ships in flame?
  haste, let us join, and combat side by side.
  the warrior thus, and thus the friend replied
   no martial toil i shun, no danger fear
  let hector come  i wait his fury here.
  but jove with conquest crowns the trojan train
  and, jove our foe, all human force is vain.
  he sigh'd  but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,
  and from his car the proud thymbraeus fell
  molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,
  his death ennobled by ulysses' sword.
  there slain, they left them in eternal night,
  then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.
  so two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,
  then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.
  stern hector's conquests in the middle plain
  stood check'd awhile, and greece respired again.
  the sons of merops shone amidst the war
  towering they rode in one refulgent car
  in deep prophetic arts their father skill'd,
  had warn'd his children from the trojan field.
  fate urged them on  the father warn'd in vain
  they rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain
  their breasts no more the vital spirit warms
  the stern tydides strips their shining arms.
  hypirochus by great ulysses dies,
  and rich hippodamus becomes his prize.
  great jove from ide with slaughter fills his sight,
  and level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.
  by tydeus' lance agastrophus was slain,
  the far-famed hero of paeonian strain
  wing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,
  his steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh
  through broken orders, swifter than the wind,
  he fled, but flying left his life behind.
  this hector sees, as his experienced eyes
  traverse the files, and to the rescue flies
  shouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend,
  and moving armies on his march attend.
  great diomed himself was seized with fear,
  and thus bespoke his brother of the war
   mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!
  the storm rolls on, and hector rules the field
  here stand his utmost force. --the warrior said
  swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled
  nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced
  razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.
  safe in his helm  the gift of phoebus' hands
  without a wound the trojan hero stands
  but yet so stunn'd, that, staggering on the plain.
  his arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain
  o'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,
  and a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.
  tydides followed to regain his lance
  while hector rose, recover'd from the trance,
  remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd
  the greek pursues him, and exults aloud
   once more thank phoebus for thy forfeit breath,
  or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.
  well by apollo are thy prayers repaid,
  and oft that partial power has lent his aid.
  thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,
  if any god assist tydides' hand.
  fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,
  whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay,
  him, while he triumph'd, paris eyed from far,
   the spouse of helen, the fair cause of war
  around the fields his feather'd shafts he sent,
  from ancient ilus' ruin'd monument
  behind the column placed, he bent his bow,
  and wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe
  just as he stoop'd, agastrophus's crest
  to seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,
  the bowstring twang'd  nor flew the shaft in vain,
  but pierced his foot, and nail'd it to the plain.
  the laughing trojan, with a joyful spring.
  leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.
   he bleeds!  he cries  some god has sped my dart!
  would the same god had fix'd it in his heart!
  so troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,
  should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand
  whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,
  as scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear.
  he dauntless thus   thou conqueror of the fair,
  thou woman-warrior with the curling hair
  vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,
  unskill'd in arms to act a manly part!
  thou hast but done what boys or women can
  such hands may wound, but not incense a man.
  nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,
  a coward's weapon never hurts the brave.
  not so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel
  fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel
  where this but lights, some noble life expires
  its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,
  steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,
  and leaves such objects as distract the fair.
  ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,
  before him steps, and bending draws the dart
  forth flows the blood  an eager pang succeeds
  tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.
  now on the field ulysses stands alone,
  the greeks all fled, the trojans pouring on
  but stands collected in himself, and whole,
  and questions thus his own unconquer'd soul
   what further subterfuge, what hopes remain?
  what shame, inglorious if i quit the plain?
  what danger, singly if i stand the ground,
  my friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?
  yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,
  the brave meets danger, and the coward flies.
  to die or conquer, proves a hero's heart
  and, knowing this, i know a soldier's part.
  such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,
  near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd
  these, in the warrior, their own fate enclose
  and round him deep the steely circle grows.
  so fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds
  of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds
  he grinds his ivory tusks  he foams with ire
  his sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire
  by these, by those, on every part is plied
  and the red slaughter spreads on every side.
  pierced through the shoulder, first deiopis fell
  next ennomus and thoon sank to hell
  chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,
  falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
  charops, the son of hippasus, was near
  ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear
  but to his aid his brother socus flies,
  socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.
  near as he drew, the warrior thus began
   o great ulysses! much-enduring man!
  not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,
  than worn to toils, and active in the fight!
  this day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,
  and end at once the great hippasian race,
  or thou beneath this lance must press the field.
  he said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield
  through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,
  plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.
  by pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,
  stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.
  the wound not mortal wise ulysses knew,
  then furious thus  but first some steps withdrew
   unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,
  fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.
  nor longer check my conquests on the foe
  but, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,
  and add one spectre to the realms below!
  he spoke, while socus, seized with sudden fright,
  trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight
  between his shoulders pierced the following dart,
  and held its passage through the panting heart
  wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound
  he falls  his armour rings against the ground.
  then thus ulysses, gazing on the slain
   famed son of hippasus! there press the plain
  there ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,
  heaven owes ulysses yet a longer date.
  ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose
  thy dying eyes no tender mother close
  but hungry birds shall tear those balls away,
  and hovering vultures scream around their prey.
  me greece shall honour, when i meet my doom,
  with solemn funerals and a lasting tomb.
  then raging with intolerable smart,
  he writhes his body, and extracts the dart.
  the dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,
  and gladden'd troy with sight of hostile blood.
  now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,
  forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.
  thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears
  the well-known voice thrice menelaus hears
  alarm'd, to ajax telamon he cried,
  who shares his labours, and defends his side
   o friend! ulysses' shouts invade my ear
  distressed he seems, and no assistance near
  strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,
  oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.
  greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,
  and feel a loss not ages can repair.
  then, where the cry directs, his course he bends
  great ajax, like the god of war, attends,
  the prudent chief in sore distress they found,
  with bands of furious trojans compass'd round.
  as when some huntsman, with a flying spear,
  from the blind thicket wounds a stately deer
  down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,
  he bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,
  till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,
  wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround
  just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,
  the lion rushes through the woodland shade,
  the wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away
  the lordly savage vindicates his prey.
  ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,
  a single warrior half a host sustains
  but soon as ajax leaves his tower-like shield,
  the scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field
  atrides' arm the sinking hero stays,
  and, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.
  victorious ajax plies the routed crew
  and first doryclus, priam's son, he slew,
  on strong pandocus next inflicts a wound,
  and lays lysander bleeding on the ground.
  as when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,
  pours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains,
  and pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,
  a country's ruins! to the seas are borne
  fierce ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng
  men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.
  but hector, from this scene of slaughter far,
  raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war
  loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,
  and deep scamander swells with heaps of slain.
  there nestor and idomeneus oppose
  the warrior's fury  there the battle glows
  there fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,
  his sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.
  the spouse of helen, dealing darts around,
  had pierced machaon with a distant wound
  in his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,
  and trembling greece for her physician fear'd.
  to nestor then idomeneus begun
   glory of greece, old neleus' valiant son!
  ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,
  and great machaon to the ships convey
  a wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal,
  is more than armies to the public weal.
  old nestor mounts the seat  beside him rode
  the wounded offspring of the healing god.
  he lends the lash  the steeds with sounding feet
  shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.
  but now cebriones, from hector's car,
  survey'd the various fortune of the war
   while here  he cried  the flying greeks are slain,
  trojans on trojans yonder load the plain.
  before great ajax see the mingled throng
  of men and chariots driven in heaps along!
  i know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field
  by the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.
  thither, o hector, thither urge thy steeds,
  there danger calls, and there the combat bleeds
  there horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,
  and groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.
  thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds
  swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds
  stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,
  o'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.
  the horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore,
  and, dashing, purple all the car before
  the groaning axle sable drops distils,
  and mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.
  here hector, plunging through the thickest fight,
  broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light
   by the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone.
  the ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown
  ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,
  and fears that arm whose force he felt so late.
  but partial jove, espousing hector's part,
  shot heaven-bred horror through the grecian's heart
  confused, unnerved in hector's presence grown,
  amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.
  o'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,
  and, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.
  thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,
  beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains
  repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,
  though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,
  long stands the showering darts, and missile fires
  then sourly slow the indignant beast retires
  so turn'd stern ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,
  while his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.
  as the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,
  in some wide field by troops of boys pursued,
  though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,
  crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain
  thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,
  the patient animal maintains his ground,
  scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,
  and stirs but slowly when he stirs at last
  on ajax thus a weight of trojans hung,
  the strokes redoubled on his buckler rung
  confiding now in bulky strength he stands,
  now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands
  now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,
  and threats his followers with retorted eye.
  fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,
  while hissing darts descend in iron showers
  in his broad buckler many a weapon stood,
  its surface bristled with a quivering wood
  and many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,
  marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.
  but bold eurypylus his aid imparts,
  and dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts
  whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,
  great apisaon felt the fatal blow
  from his torn liver the red current flow'd,
  and his slack knees desert their dying load.
  the victor rushing to despoil the dead,
  from paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled
  fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,
  fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.
  back to the lines the wounded greek retired,
  yet thus retreating, his associates fired
   what god, o grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?
  oh, turn to arms  'tis ajax claims your aid.
  this hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,
  and this the last brave battle he shall wage
  haste, join your forces  from the gloomy grave
  the warrior rescue, and your country save.
  thus urged the chief  a generous troop appears,
  who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,
  to guard their wounded friend  while thus they stand
  with pious care, great ajax joins the band
  each takes new courage at the hero's sight
  the hero rallies, and renews the fight.
  thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,
  while nestor's chariot far from fight retires
  his coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,
  the greeks' preserver, great machaon, bore.
  that hour achilles, from the topmost height
  of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight
  his feasted eyes beheld around the plain
  the grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.
  his friend machaon singled from the rest,
  a transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.
  straight to menoetius' much-loved son he sent
  graceful as mars, patroclus quits his tent
  in evil hour! then fate decreed his doom,
  and fix'd the date of all his woes to come.
   why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay
  whate'er thy will, patroclus shall obey.
   o first of friends!  pelides thus replied
  still at my heart, and ever at my side!
  the time is come, when yon despairing host
  shall learn the value of the man they lost
  now at my knees the greeks shall pour their moan,
  and proud atrides tremble on his throne.
  go now to nestor, and from him be taught
  what wounded warrior late his chariot brought
  for, seen at distance, and but seen behind,
  his form recall'd machaon to my mind
  nor could i, through yon cloud, discern his face,
  the coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace.
  the hero said. his friend obey'd with haste,
  through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd
  the chiefs descending from their car he found
  the panting steeds eurymedon unbound.
  the warriors standing on the breezy shore,
  to dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,
  here paused a moment, while the gentle gale
  convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale
  then to consult on farther methods went,
  and took their seats beneath the shady tent.
  the draught prescribed, fair hecamede prepares,
  arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs
   whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,
  greece, as the prize of nestor's wisdom gave
  a table first with azure feet she placed
  whose ample orb a brazen charger graced
  honey new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,
  and wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,
  next her white hand an antique goblet brings,
  a goblet sacred to the pylian kings
  from eldest times  emboss'd with studs of gold,
  two feet support it, and four handles hold
  on each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,
  in sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink
  a massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,
  when the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.
  temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine
  pours a large portion of the pramnian wine
  with goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,
  and last with flour the smiling surface strows
  this for the wounded prince the dame prepares
  the cordial beverage reverend nestor shares
  salubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,
  and pleasing conference beguiles the day.
  meantime patroclus, by achilles sent,
  unheard approached, and stood before the tent.
  old nestor, rising then, the hero led
  to his high seat  the chief refused and said
   'tis now no season for these kind delays
  the great achilles with impatience stays.
  to great achilles this respect i owe
  who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,
  was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?
  with grief i see the great machaon bleeds.
  this to report, my hasty course i bend
  thou know'st the fiery temper of my friend.
   can then the sons of greece  the sage rejoin'd
  excite compassion in achilles' mind?
  seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?
  this is not half the story of our woe.
  tell him, not great machaon bleeds alone,
  our bravest heroes in the navy groan,
  ulysses, agamemnon, diomed,
  and stern eurypylus, already bleed.
  but, ah! what flattering hopes i entertain!
  achilles heeds not, but derides our pain
  even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,
  and waits the rising of the fatal blaze.
  chief after chief the raging foe destroys
  calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.
  now the slow course of all-impairing time
  unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime
  oh! had i still that strength my youth possess'd,
  when this bold arm the epeian powers oppress'd,
  the bulls of elis in glad triumph led,
  and stretch'd the great itymonaeus dead!
  then from my fury fled the trembling swains,
  and ours was all the plunder of the plains
  fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,
  as many goats, as many lowing kine
  and thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,
  all teeming females, and of generous breeds.
  these, as my first essay of arms, i won
  old neleus gloried in his conquering son.
  thus elis forced, her long arrears restored,
  and shares were parted to each pylian lord.
  the state of pyle was sunk to last despair,
  when the proud elians first commenced the war
  for neleus' sons alcides' rage had slain
  of twelve bold brothers, i alone remain!
  oppress'd, we arm'd  and now this conquest gain'd,
  my sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.
   that large reprisal he might justly claim,
  for prize defrauded, and insulted fame,
  when elis' monarch, at the public course,
  detain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.
  the rest the people shared  myself survey'd
  the just partition, and due victims paid.
  three days were past, when elis rose to war,
  with many a courser, and with many a car
  the sons of actor at their army's head
   young as they were  the vengeful squadrons led.
  high on the rock fair thryoessa stands,
  our utmost frontier on the pylian lands
  not far the streams of famed alphaeus flow
  the stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.
  pallas, descending in the shades of night,
  alarms the pylians and commands the fight.
  each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,
  myself the foremost  but my sire denied
  fear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms
  and stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.
  my sire denied in vain  on foot i fled
  amidst our chariots  for the goddess led.
   along fair arene's delightful plain
  soft minyas rolls his waters to the main
  there, horse and foot, the pylian troops unite,
  and sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.
  thence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,
  to great alphaeus' sacred source we came.
  there first to jove our solemn rites were paid
  an untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid
  a bull, alphaeus  and a bull was slain
  to the blue monarch of the watery main.
  in arms we slept, beside the winding flood,
  while round the town the fierce epeians stood.
  soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,
  flamed in the front of heaven, and gave the day.
  bright scenes of arms, and works of war appear
  the nations meet  there pylos, elis here.
  the first who fell, beneath my javelin bled
  king augias' son, and spouse of agamede
   she that all simples' healing virtues knew,
  and every herb that drinks the morning dew
  i seized his car, the van of battle led
  the epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.
  the foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,
  fierce as the whirlwind now i swept the field
  full fifty captive chariots graced my train
  two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.
  then actor's sons had died, but neptune shrouds
  the youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.
  o'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,
  collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,
  through wide buprasian fields we forced the foes,
  where o'er the vales the olenian rocks arose
  till pallas stopp'd us where alisium flows.
  even there the hindmost of the rear i slay,
  and the same arm that led concludes the day
  then back to pyle triumphant take my way.
  there to high jove were public thanks assign'd,
  as first of gods  to nestor, of mankind.
  such then i was, impell'd by youthful blood
  so proved my valour for my country's good.
   achilles with unactive fury glows,
  and gives to passion what to greece he owes.
  how shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade
  her hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!
    friend! my memory recalls the day,
  when, gathering aids along the grecian sea,
  i, and ulysses, touch'd at phthia's port,
  and entered peleus' hospitable court.
  a bull to jove he slew in sacrifice,
  and pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.
  thyself, achilles, and thy reverend sire
  menoetius, turn'd the fragments on the fire.
  achilles sees us, to the feast invites
  social we sit, and share the genial rites.
  we then explained the cause on which we came,
  urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.
  your ancient fathers generous precepts gave
  peleus said only this --'my son! be brave.'
  menoetius thus  'though great achilles shine
  in strength superior, and of race divine,
  yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend
  let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'
  thus spoke your father at thessalia's court
  words now forgot, though now of vast import.
  ah! try the utmost that a friend can say
  such gentle force the fiercest minds obey
  some favouring god achilles' heart may move
  though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.
  if some dire oracle his breast alarm,
  if aught from heaven withhold his saving arm,
  some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine,
  if thou but lead the myrmidonian line
  clad in achilles' arms, if thou appear,
  proud troy may tremble, and desist from war
  press'd by fresh forces, her o'er-labour'd train
  shall seek their walls, and greece respire again.
  this touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent
  along the shore with hasty strides he went
  soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,
  the public mart and courts of justice stand,
  where the tall fleet of great ulysses lies,
  and altars to the guardian gods arise
  there, sad, he met the brave euaemon's son,
  large painful drops from all his members run
  an arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,
  the sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.
  as faintly reeling he confess'd the smart,
  weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.
  divine compassion touch'd patroclus' breast,
  who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address'd
   ah, hapless leaders of the grecian host!
  thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?
  is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,
  far from your friends, and from your native shore?
  say, great eurypylus! shall greece yet stand?
  resists she yet the raging hector's hand?
  or are her heroes doom'd to die with shame,
  and this the period of our wars and fame?
  eurypylus replies   no more, my friend
  greece is no more! this day her glories end
  even to the ships victorious troy pursues,
  her force increasing as her toil renews.
  those chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,
  lie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.
  but, thou, patroclus! act a friendly part,
  lead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart
  with lukewarm water wash the gore away
  with healing balms the raging smart allay,
  such as sage chiron, sire of pharmacy,
  once taught achilles, and achilles thee.
  of two famed surgeons, podalirius stands
  this hour surrounded by the trojan bands
  and great machaon, wounded in his tent,
  now wants that succour which so oft he lent.
  to him the chief   what then remains to do?
  the event of things the gods alone can view.
  charged by achilles' great command i fly,
  and bear with haste the pylian king's reply
  but thy distress this instant claims relief.
  he said, and in his arms upheld the chief.
  the slaves their master's slow approach survey'd,
  and hides of oxen on the floor display'd
  there stretch'd at length the wounded hero lay
  patroclus cut the forky steel away
  then in his hands a bitter root he bruised
  the wound he wash'd, the styptic juice infused.
  the closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,
  the wound to torture, and the blood to flow.
  while thus the hero's pious cares attend
  the cure and safety of his wounded friend,
  trojans and greeks with clashing shields engage,
  and mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.
  nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose
  with gods averse the ill-fated works arose
  their powers neglected, and no victim slain,
  the walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.
  without the gods, how short a period stands
  the proudest monument of mortal hands!
  this stood while hector and achilles raged.
  while sacred troy the warring hosts engaged
  but when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,
  and what survived of greece to greece return'd
  then neptune and apollo shook the shore,
  then ida's summits pour'd their watery store
  rhesus and rhodius then unite their rills,
  caresus roaring down the stony hills,
   sepus, granicus, with mingled force,
  and xanthus foaming from his fruitful source
  and gulfy simois, rolling to the main
  helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain
  these, turn'd by phoebus from their wonted ways,
  deluged the rampire nine continual days
  the weight of waters saps the yielding wall,
  and to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.
  incessant cataracts the thunderer pours,
  and half the skies descend in sluicy showers.
  the god of ocean, marching stern before,
  with his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,
  vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,
  and whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.
  now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood,
  no fragment tells where once the wonder stood
  in their old bounds the rivers roll again,
  shine 'twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.
  but this the gods in later times perform
  as yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm
  the strokes yet echoed of contending powers
  war thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.
  smote by the arm of jove with dire dismay,
  close by their hollow ships the grecians lay
  hector's approach in every wind they hear,
  and hector's fury every moment fear.
  he, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,
  mingled the troops, and drove the field along.
  so 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,
  fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands
  arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,
  and hissing javelins rain an iron storm
  his powers untamed, their bold assault defy,
  and where he turns the rout disperse or die
  he foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,
  and if he falls, his courage makes him fall.
  with equal rage encompass'd hector glows
  exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.
  the panting steeds impatient fury breathe,
  and snort and tremble at the gulf beneath
  just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,
  and the turf trembles, and the skies resound.
  eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,
  vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep
  the bottom bare,  a formidable show!
  and bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.
  the foot alone this strong defence could force,
  and try the pass impervious to the horse.
  this saw polydamas  who, wisely brave,
  restrain'd great hector, and this counsel gave
   o thou, bold leader of the trojan bands!
  and you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!
  what entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,
  the stakes beneath, the grecian walls behind?
  no pass through those, without a thousand wounds,
  no space for combat in yon narrow bounds.
  proud of the favours mighty jove has shown,
  on certain dangers we too rashly run
  if 'tis will our haughty foes to tame,
  oh may this instant end the grecian name!
  here, far from argos, let their heroes fall,
  and one great day destroy and bury all!
  but should they turn, and here oppress our train,
  what hopes, what methods of retreat remain?
  wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,
  in one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,
  all troy must perish, if their arms prevail,
  nor shall a trojan live to tell the tale.
  hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed
  back from the trenches let your steeds be led
  then all alighting, wedged in firm array,
  proceed on foot, and hector lead the way.
  so greece shall stoop before our conquering power,
  and this  if jove consent  her fatal hour.
  this counsel pleased  the godlike hector sprung
  swift from his seat  his clanging armour rung.
  the chief's example follow'd by his train,
  each quits his car, and issues on the plain,
  by orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd
  compel the coursers to their ranks behind.
  the forces part in five distinguish'd bands,
  and all obey their several chiefs' commands.
  the best and bravest in the first conspire,
  pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire
  great hector glorious in the van of these,
  polydamas, and brave cebriones.
  before the next the graceful paris shines,
  and bold alcathous, and agenor joins.
  the sons of priam with the third appear,
  deiphobus, and helenas the seer
  in arms with these the mighty asius stood,
  who drew from hyrtacus his noble blood,
  and whom arisba's yellow coursers bore,
  the coursers fed on selle's winding shore.
  antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide,
  and great  neas, born on fountful ide.
  divine sarpedon the last band obey'd,
  whom glaucus and asteropaeus aid.
  next him, the bravest, at their army's head,
  but he more brave than all the hosts he led.
  now with compacted shields in close array,
  the moving legions speed their headlong way
  already in their hopes they fire the fleet,
  and see the grecians gasping at their feet.
  while every trojan thus, and every aid,
  the advice of wise polydamas obey'd,
  asius alone, confiding in his car,
  his vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.
  unhappy hero! and advised in vain
  those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain
  no more those coursers with triumphant joy
  restore their master to the gates of troy!
  black death attends behind the grecian wall,
  and great idomeneus shall boast thy fall!
  fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain
  the flying grecians strove their ships to gain
  swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd,
  the gates half-open'd to receive the last.
  thither, exulting in his force, he flies
  his following host with clamours rend the skies
  to plunge the grecians headlong in the main,
  such their proud hopes  but all their hopes were vain!
  to guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,
  who from the lapiths' warlike race descend
  this polypoetes, great perithous' heir,
  and that leonteus, like the god of war.
  as two tall oaks, before the wall they rise
  their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies
  whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd,
  forbid the tempest, and protect the ground
  high on the hills appears their stately form,
  and their deep roots for ever brave the storm.
  so graceful these, and so the shock they stand
  of raging asius, and his furious band.
  orestes, acamas, in front appear,
  and oenomaus and thoon close the rear
  in vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,
  in vain around them beat their hollow shields
  the fearless brothers on the grecians call,
  to guard their navies, and defend the wall.
  even when they saw troy's sable troops impend,
  and greece tumultuous from her towers descend,
  forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair,
  opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.
  so two wild boars spring furious from their den,
  roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men
  on every side the crackling trees they tear,
  and root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare
  they gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,
  till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.
  around their heads the whistling javelins sung,
  with sounding strokes their brazen targets rung
  fierce was the fight, while yet the grecian powers
  maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers
  to save their fleet their last efforts they try,
  and stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.
  as when sharp boreas blows abroad, and brings
  the dreary winter on his frozen wings
  beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow
  descend, and whiten all the fields below
  so fast the darts on either army pour,
  so down the rampires rolls the rocky shower
  heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields,
  and the deaf echo rattles round the fields.
  with shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,
  the frantic asius thus accuses heaven
   in powers immortal who shall now believe?
  can those too flatter, and can jove deceive?
  what man could doubt but troy's victorious power
  should humble greece, and this her fatal hour?
  but like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,
  to guard the entrance of their common hive,
  darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings
  they strike the assailants, and infix their stings
  a race determined, that to death contend
  so fierce these greeks their last retreats defend.
  gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,
  repel an army, and defraud the fates?
  these empty accents mingled with the wind,
  nor moved great jove's unalterable mind
  to godlike hector and his matchless might
  was owed the glory of the destined fight.
  like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,
  and all the gates sustain'd an equal tide
  through the long walls the stony showers were heard,
  the blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.
  the spirit of a god my breast inspire,
  to raise each act to life, and sing with fire!
  while greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,
  secure of death, confiding in despair
  and all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,
  with unassisting arms deplored the day.
  even yet the dauntless lapithae maintain
  the dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.
  first damasus, by polypoetes' steel,
  pierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell
  the weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!
  the warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!
  next ormenus and pylon yield their breath
  nor less leonteus strews the field with death
  first through the belt hippomachus he gored,
  then sudden waved his unresisted sword
  antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,
  the falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke
  iamenus, orestes, menon, bled
  and round him rose a monument of dead.
  meantime, the bravest of the trojan crew,
  bold hector and polydamas, pursue
  fierce with impatience on the works to fall,
  and wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.
  these on the farther bank now stood and gazed,
  by heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed
  a signal omen stopp'd the passing host,
  their martial fury in their wonder lost.
  jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies
  a bleeding serpent of enormous size,
  his talons truss'd  alive, and curling round,
  he stung the bird, whose throat received the wound
  mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,
  in airy circles wings his painful way,
  floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries
  amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.
  they, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,
  and jove's portent with beating hearts behold.
  then first polydamas the silence broke,
  long weigh'd the signal, and to hector spoke
   how oft, my brother, thy reproach i bear,
  for words well meant, and sentiments sincere?
  true to those counsels which i judge the best,
  i tell the faithful dictates of my breast.
  to speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,
  in peace, in war, in council, and in fight
  and all i move, deferring to thy sway,
  but tends to raise that power which i obey.
  then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!
  seek not this day the grecian ships to gain
  for sure, to warn us, jove his omen sent,
  and thus my mind explains its clear event
  the victor eagle, whose sinister flight
  retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,
  dismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,
  allow'd to seize, but not possess the prize
  thus, though we gird with fires the grecian fleet,
  though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,
  toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed
  more woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.
  so bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise
  for thus a skilful seer would read the skies.
  to him then hector with disdain return'd
   fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn'd
   are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?
  thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong
  or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,
  sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.
  what coward counsels would thy madness move
  against the word, the will reveal'd of jove?
  the leading sign, the irrevocable nod,
  and happy thunders of the favouring god,
  these shall i slight, and guide my wavering mind
  by wandering birds that flit with every wind?
  ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,
  or where the suns arise, or where descend
  to right, to left, unheeded take your way,
  while i the dictates of high heaven obey.
  without a sign his sword the brave man draws,
  and asks no omen but his country's cause.
  but why should'st thou suspect the war's success?
  none fears it more, as none promotes it less
  though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,
  trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.
  troy and her sons may find a general grave,
  but thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.
  yet should the fears that wary mind suggests
  spread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts,
  my javelin can revenge so base a part,
  and free the soul that quivers in thy heart.
  furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,
  calls on his host  his host obey the call
  with ardour follow where their leader flies
  redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.
  jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of ide,
  and drifts of dust the clouded navy hide
  he fills the greeks with terror and dismay,
  and gives great hector the predestined day.
  strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,
  close to the works their rigid siege they laid.
  in vain the mounds and massy beams defend,
  while these they undermine, and those they rend
  upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall
  and heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.
  greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms
  the crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,
  shield touching shield, a long refulgent row
  whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.
  the bold ajaces fly from tower to tower,
  and rouse, with flame divine, the grecian power.
  the generous impulse every greek obeys
  threats urge the fearful  and the valiant, praise.
   fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,
  and you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!
  since not alike endued with force or art
  behold a day when each may act his part!
  a day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,
  to gain new glories, or augment the old.
  urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite
  drown hector's vaunts in loud exhorts of fight
  conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all
  seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall
  so jove once more may drive their routed train,
  and troy lie trembling in her walls again.
  their ardour kindles all the grecian powers
  and now the stones descend in heavier showers.
  as when high jove his sharp artillery forms,
  and opes his cloudy magazine of storms
  in winter's bleak un comfortable reign,
  a snowy inundation hides the plain
  he stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep
  then pours the silent tempest thick and deep
  and first the mountain-tops are cover'd o'er,
  then the green fields, and then the sandy shore
  bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,
  and one bright waste hides all the works of men
  the circling seas, alone absorbing all,
  drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall
  so from each side increased the stony rain,
  and the white ruin rises o'er the plain.
  thus godlike hector and his troops contend
  to force the ramparts, and the gates to rend
  nor troy could conquer, nor the greeks would yield,
  till great sarpedon tower'd amid the field
  for mighty jove inspired with martial flame
  his matchless son, and urged him on to fame.
  in arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,
  and bears aloft his ample shield in air
  within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd,
  ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold
  and while two pointed javelins arm his hands,
  majestic moves along, and leads his lycian bands.
  so press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow
  descends a lion on the flocks below
  so stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,
  in sullen majesty, and stern disdain
  in vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,
  and shepherds gall him with an iron war
  regardless, furious, he pursues his way
  he foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.
  resolved alike, divine sarpedon glows
  with generous rage that drives him on the foes.
  he views the towers, and meditates their fall,
  to sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall
  then casting on his friend an ardent look,
  fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke
   why boast we, glaucus! our extended reign,
  where xanthus' streams enrich the lycian plain,
  our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,
  and hills where vines their purple harvest yield,
  our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,
  our feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?
  why on those shores are we with joy survey'd,
  admired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,
  unless great acts superior merit prove,
  and vindicate the bounteous powers above?
  'tis ours, the dignity they give to grace
  the first in valour, as the first in place
  that when with wondering eyes our martial bands
  behold our deeds transcending our commands,
  such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,
  whom those that envy dare not imitate!
  could all our care elude the gloomy grave,
  which claims no less the fearful and the brave,
  for lust of fame i should not vainly dare
  in fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.
  but since, alas! ignoble age must come,
  disease, and death's inexorable doom
  the life, which others pay, let us bestow,
  and give to fame what we to nature owe
  brave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,
  or let us glory gain, or glory give!
  he said  his words the listening chief inspire
  with equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire
  the troops pursue their leaders with delight,
  rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.
  menestheus from on high the storm beheld
  threatening the fort, and blackening in the field
  around the walls he gazed, to view from far
  what aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,
  and saw where teucer with the ajaces stood,
  of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.
  in vain he calls  the din of helms and shields
  rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,
  the brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,
  heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground
  then thus to thoos   hence with speed  he said ,
  and urge the bold ajaces to our aid
  their strength, united, best may help to bear
  the bloody labours of the doubtful war
  hither the lycian princes bend their course,
  the best and bravest of the hostile force.
  but if too fiercely there the foes contend,
  let telamon, at least, our towers defend,
  and teucer haste with his unerring bow
  to share the danger, and repel the foe.
  swift, at the word, the herald speeds along
  the lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,
  and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,
  opposed in combat on the dusty shore.
   ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!
  your aid  said thoos  peteus' son demands
  your strength, united, best may help to bear
  the bloody labours of the doubtful war
  thither the lycian princes bend their course,
  the best and bravest of the hostile force.
  but if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,
  at least, let telamon those towers defend,
  and teucer haste with his unerring bow
  to share the danger, and repel the foe.
  straight to the fort great ajax turn'd his care,
  and thus bespoke his brothers of the war
   now, valiant lycomede! exert your might,
  and, brave oileus, prove your force in fight
  to you i trust the fortune of the field,
  till by this arm the foe shall be repell'd
  that done, expect me to complete the day
  then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.
  with equal steps bold teucer press'd the shore,
  whose fatal bow the strong pandion bore.
  high on the walls appear'd the lycian powers,
  like some black tempest gathering round the towers
  the greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite,
  prepared to labour in the unequal fight
  the war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise
  tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.
  fierce ajax first the advancing host invades,
  and sends the brave epicles to the shades,
  sarpedon's friend. across the warrior's way,
  rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay
  in modern ages not the strongest swain
  could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain
  he poised, and swung it round  then toss'd on high,
  it flew with force, and labour'd up the sky
  full on the lycian's helmet thundering down,
  the ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.
  as skilful divers from some airy steep
  headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,
  so falls epicles  then in groans expires,
  and murmuring to the shades the soul retires.
  while to the ramparts daring glaucus drew,
  from teucer's hand a winged arrow flew
  the bearded shaft the destined passage found,
  and on his naked arm inflicts a wound.
  the chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast
  might stop the progress of his warlike host,
  conceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height
  retired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.
  divine sarpedon with regret beheld
  disabled glaucus slowly quit the field
  his beating breast with generous ardour glows,
  he springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.
  alcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel
  deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel
  then from the yawning wound with fury tore
  the spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore
  down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,
  his brazen armour rings against the ground.
  swift to the battlement the victor flies,
  tugs with full force, and every nerve applies
  it shakes  the ponderous stones disjointed yield
  the rolling ruins smoke along the field.
  a mighty breach appears  the walls lie bare
  and, like a deluge, rushes in the war.
  at once bold teucer draws the twanging bow,
  and ajax sends his javelin at the foe
  fix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,
  and through his buckler drove the trembling wood
  but jove was present in the dire debate,
  to shield his offspring, and avert his fate.
  the prince gave back, not meditating flight,
  but urging vengeance, and severer fight
  then raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,
  his fainting squadrons to new fury warms.
   o where, ye lycians, is the strength you boast?
  your former fame and ancient virtue lost!
  the breach lies open, but your chief in vain
  attempts alone the guarded pass to gain
  unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall
  the force of powerful union conquers all.
  this just rebuke inflamed the lycian crew
  they join, they thicken, and the assault renew
  unmoved the embodied greeks their fury dare,
  and fix'd support the weight of all the war
  nor could the greeks repel the lycian powers,
  nor the bold lycians force the grecian towers.
  as on the confines of adjoining grounds,
  two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds
  they tug, they sweat  but neither gain, nor yield,
  one foot, one inch, of the contended field
  thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall
  nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.
  their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,
  loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound
  the copious slaughter covers all the shore,
  and the high ramparts drip with human gore.
  as when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,
  from side to side the trembling balance nods,
   while some laborious matron, just and poor,
  with nice exactness weighs her woolly store,
  till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends
  each equal weight  nor this, nor that, descends
  so stood the war, till hector's matchless might,
  with fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.
  fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,
  and fires his host with loud repeated cries.
   advance, ye trojans! lend your valiant hands,
  haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!
  they hear, they run  and, gathering at his call,
  raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall
  around the works a wood of glittering spears
  shoots up, and all the rising host appears.
  a ponderous stone bold hector heaved to throw,
  pointed above, and rough and gross below
  not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
  such men as live in these degenerate days
  yet this, as easy as a swain could bear
  the snowy fleece, he toss'd, and shook in air
  for jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load
  the unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.
  thus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,
  of massy substance, and stupendous frame
  with iron bars and brazen hinges strong,
  on lofty beams of solid timber hung
  then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,
  drives the sharp rock  the solid beams give way,
  the folds are shatter'd  from the crackling door
  leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.
  now rushing in, the furious chief appears,
  gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears
  a dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,
  and from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.
  he moves a god, resistless in his course,
  and seems a match for more than mortal force.
  then pouring after, through the gaping space,
  a tide of trojans flows, and fills the place
  the greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly
  the shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.
  when now the thunderer on the sea-beat coast
  had fix'd great hector and his conquering host,
  he left them to the fates, in bloody fray
  to toil and struggle through the well-fought day.
  then turn'd to thracia from the field of fight
  those eyes that shed insufferable light,
  to where the mysians prove their martial force,
  and hardy thracians tame the savage horse
  and where the far-famed hippomolgian strays,
  renown'd for justice and for length of days
  thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,
  from milk, innoxious, seek their simple food
  jove sees delighted  and avoids the scene
  of guilty troy, of arms, and dying men
  no aid, he deems, to either host is given,
  while his high law suspends the powers of heaven.
  meantime the monarch of the watery main
  observed the thunderer, nor observed in vain.
  in samothracia, on a mountain's brow,
  whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below,
  he sat  and round him cast his azure eyes
  where ida's misty tops confusedly rise
  below, fair ilion's glittering spires were seen
  the crowded ships and sable seas between.
  there, from the crystal chambers of the main
  emerged, he sat, and mourn'd his argives slain.
  at jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,
  prone down the rocky steep he rush'd along
  fierce as he pass'd, the lofty mountains nod,
  the forest shakes  earth trembled as he trod,
  and felt the footsteps of the immortal god.
  from realm to realm three ample strides he took,
  and, at the fourth, the distant  gae shook.
  far in the bay his shining palace stands,
  eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands
  this having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd steeds he reins,
  fleet as the winds, and deck'd with golden manes.
  refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,
  immortal arms of adamant and gold.
  he mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,
  he sits superior, and the chariot flies
  his whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep
  the enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep
  gambol around him on the watery way,
  and heavy whales in awkward measures play
  the sea subsiding spreads a level plain,
  exults, and owns the monarch of the main
  the parting waves before his coursers fly
  the wondering waters leave his axle dry.
  deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,
  between where tenedos the surges lave,
  and rocky imbrus breaks the rolling wave
  there the great ruler of the azure round
  stopp'd his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,
  fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,
  and link'd their fetlocks with a golden band,
  infrangible, immortal  there they stay
  the father of the floods pursues his way
  where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,
  or fiery deluge that devours the ground,
  the impatient trojans, in a gloomy throng,
  embattled roll'd, as hector rush'd along
  to the loud tumult and the barbarous cry
  the heavens re-echo, and the shores reply
  they vow destruction to the grecian name,
  and in their hopes the fleets already flame.
  but neptune, rising from the seas profound,
  the god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,
  now wears a mortal form  like calchas seen,
  such his loud voice, and such his manly mien
  his shouts incessant every greek inspire,
  but most the ajaces, adding fire to fire.
   'tis yours, o warriors, all our hopes to raise
  oh recollect your ancient worth and praise!
  'tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear
  flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.
  on other works though troy with fury fall,
  and pour her armies o'er our batter'd wall
  there greece has strength  but this, this part o'erthrown,
  her strength were vain  i dread for you alone
  here hector rages like the force of fire,
  vaunts of his gods, and calls high jove his sire
  if yet some heavenly power your breast excite,
  breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,
  greece yet may live, her threaten'd fleet maintain
  and hector's force, and jove's own aid, be vain.
  then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,
  he touch'd the chiefs, and steel'd their manly souls
  strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,
  prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.
  then, as a falcon from the rocky height,
  her quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,
  forth-springing instant, darts herself from high,
  shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky
  such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew
  the wide horizon shut him from their view.
  the inspiring god oileus' active son
  perceived the first, and thus to telamon
   some god, my friend, some god in human form
  favouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.
  not calchas this, the venerable seer
  short as he turned, i saw the power appear
  i mark'd his parting, and the steps he trod
  his own bright evidence reveals a god.
  even now some energy divine i share,
  and seem to walk on wings, and tread in air!
   with equal ardour  telamon returns
  my soul is kindled, and my bosom burns
  new rising spirits all my force alarm,
  lift each impatient limb, and brace my arm.
  this ready arm, unthinking, shakes the dart
  the blood pours back, and fortifies my heart
  singly, methinks, yon towering chief i meet,
  and stretch the dreadful hector at my feet.
  full of the god that urged their burning breast,
  the heroes thus their mutual warmth express'd.
  neptune meanwhile the routed greeks inspired
  who, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired,
  pant in the ships  while troy to conquest calls,
  and swarms victorious o'er their yielding walls
  trembling before the impending storm they lie,
  while tears of rage stand burning in their eye.
  greece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour
  but breathe new courage as they feel the power.
  teucer and leitus first his words excite
  then stern peneleus rises to the fight
  thoas, deipyrus, in arms renown'd,
  and merion next, the impulsive fury found
  last nestor's son the same bold ardour takes,
  while thus the god the martial fire awakes
   oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace
  to chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!
  i trusted in the gods, and you, to see
  brave greece victorious, and her navy free
  ah, no--the glorious combat you disclaim,
  and one black day clouds all her former fame.
  heavens! what a prodigy these eyes survey,
  unseen, unthought, till this amazing day!
  fly we at length from troy's oft-conquer'd bands?
  and falls our fleet by such inglorious hands?
  a rout undisciplined, a straggling train,
  not born to glories of the dusty plain
  like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued,
  a prey to every savage of the wood
  shall these, so late who trembled at your name,
  invade your camps, involve your ships in flame?
  a change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?
  the soldiers' baseness, or the general's fault?
  fools! will ye perish for your leader's vice
  the purchase infamy, and life the price?
  'tis not your cause, achilles' injured fame
  another's is the crime, but yours the shame.
  grant that our chief offend through rage or lust,
  must you be cowards, if your king's unjust?
  prevent this evil, and your country save
  small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave.
  think, and subdue! on dastards dead to fame
  i waste no anger, for they feel no shame
  but you, the pride, the flower of all our host,
  my heart weeps blood to see your glory lost!
  nor deem this day, this battle, all you lose
  a day more black, a fate more vile, ensues.
  let each reflect, who prizes fame or breath,
  on endless infamy, on instant death
  for, lo! the fated time, the appointed shore
  hark! the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar!
  impetuous hector thunders at the wall
  the hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall.
  these words the grecians' fainting hearts inspire,
  and listening armies catch the godlike fire.
  fix'd at his post was each bold ajax found,
  with well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round
  so close their order, so disposed their fight,
  as pallas' self might view with fix'd delight
  or had the god of war inclined his eyes,
  the god of war had own'd a just surprise.
  a chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate,
  descending hector and his battle wait.
  an iron scene gleams dreadful o'er the fields,
  armour in armour lock'd, and shields in shields,
  spears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,
  helms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.
  the floating plumes unnumber'd wave above,
  as when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove
  and levell'd at the skies with pointing rays,
  their brandish'd lances at each motion blaze.
  thus breathing death, in terrible array,
  the close compacted legions urged their way
  fierce they drove on, impatient to destroy
  troy charged the first, and hector first of troy.
  as from some mountain's craggy forehead torn,
  a rock's round fragment flies, with fury borne,
   which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends,
  precipitate the ponderous mass descends
  from steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds
  at every shock the crackling wood resounds
  still gathering force, it smokes  and urged amain,
  whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain
  there stops--so hector. their whole force he proved,
  resistless when he raged, and, when he stopp'd, unmoved.
  on him the war is bent, the darts are shed,
  and all their falchions wave around his head
  repulsed he stands, nor from his stand retires
  but with repeated shouts his army fires.
   trojans! be firm  this arm shall make your way
  through yon square body, and that black array
  stand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,
  strong as they seem, embattled like a tower
  for he that juno's heavenly bosom warms,
  the first of gods, this day inspires our arms.
  he said  and roused the soul in every breast
  urged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,
  forth march'd deiphobus  but, marching, held
  before his wary steps his ample shield.
  bold merion aim'd a stroke  nor aim'd it wide
  the glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide
  but pierced not through  unfaithful to his hand,
  the point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.
  the trojan warrior, touch'd with timely fear,
  on the raised orb to distance bore the spear.
  the greek, retreating, mourn'd his frustrate blow,
  and cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe
  then to the ships with surly speed he went,
  to seek a surer javelin in his tent.
  meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,
  the tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.
  by teucer's arm the warlike imbrius bleeds,
  the son of mentor, rich in generous steeds.
  ere yet to troy the sons of greece were led,
  in fair pedaeus' verdant pastures bred,
  the youth had dwelt, remote from war's alarms,
  and blest in bright medesicaste's arms
   this nymph, the fruit of priam's ravish'd joy,
  allied the warrior to the house of troy
  to troy, when glory call'd his arms, he came,
  and match'd the bravest of her chiefs in fame
  with priam's sons, a guardian of the throne,
  he lived, beloved and honour'd as his own.
  him teucer pierced between the throat and ear
  he groans beneath the telamonian spear.
  as from some far-seen mountain's airy crown,
  subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,
  and soils its verdant tresses on the ground
  so falls the youth  his arms the fall resound.
  then teucer rushing to despoil the dead,
  from hector's hand a shining javelin fled
  he saw, and shunn'd the death  the forceful dart
  sung on, and pierced amphimachus's heart,
  cteatus' son, of neptune's forceful line
  vain was his courage, and his race divine!
  prostrate he falls  his clanging arms resound,
  and his broad buckler thunders on the ground.
  to seize his beamy helm the victor flies,
  and just had fastened on the dazzling prize,
  when ajax' manly arm a javelin flung
  full on the shield's round boss the weapon rung
  he felt the shock, nor more was doom'd to feel,
  secure in mail, and sheath'd in shining steel.
  repulsed he yields  the victor greeks obtain
  the spoils contested, and bear off the slain.
  between the leaders of the athenian line,
   stichius the brave, menestheus the divine,
  deplored amphimachus, sad object! lies
  imbrius remains the fierce ajaces' prize.
  as two grim lions bear across the lawn,
  snatch'd from devouring hounds, a slaughter'd fawn.
  in their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,
  and sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood
  so these, the chief  great ajax from the dead
  strips his bright arms  oileus lops his head
  toss'd like a ball, and whirl'd in air away,
  at hector's feet the gory visage lay.
  the god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,
  and pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,
  inspires the grecian hearts, confirms their hands,
  and breathes destruction on the trojan bands.
  swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,
  he finds the lance-famed idomen of crete,
  his pensive brow the generous care express'd
  with which a wounded soldier touch'd his breast,
  whom in the chance of war a javelin tore,
  and his sad comrades from the battle bore
  him to the surgeons of the camp he sent
  that office paid, he issued from his tent
  fierce for the fight  to whom the god begun,
  in thoas' voice, andraemon's valiant son,
  who ruled where calydon's white rocks arise,
  and pleuron's chalky cliffs emblaze the skies
   where's now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,
  of greece victorious, and proud ilion lost?
  to whom the king   on greece no blame be thrown
  arms are her trade, and war is all her own.
  her hardy heroes from the well-fought plains
  nor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains
  'tis heaven, alas! and jove's all-powerful doom,
  that far, far distant from our native home
  wills us to fall inglorious! oh, my friend!
  once foremost in the fight, still prone to lend
  or arms or counsels, now perform thy best,
  and what thou canst not singly, urge the rest.
  thus he  and thus the god whose force can make
  the solid globe's eternal basis shake
   ah! never may he see his native land,
  but feed the vultures on this hateful strand,
  who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,
  nor dares to combat on this signal day!
  for this, behold! in horrid arms i shine,
  and urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.
  together let us battle on the plain
  two, not the worst  nor even this succour vain
  not vain the weakest, if their force unite
  but ours, the bravest have confess'd in fight.
  this said, he rushes where the combat burns
  swift to his tent the cretan king returns
  from thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,
  and clad in arms that lighten'd all the strand,
  fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,
  like lightning bursting from the arm of jove,
  which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,
  or terrifies the offending world with wars
  in streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,
  from pole to pole the trail of glory flies
  thus his bright armour o'er the dazzled throng
  gleam'd dreadful, as the monarch flash'd along.
  him, near his tent, meriones attends
  whom thus he questions   ever best of friends!
  o say, in every art of battle skill'd,
  what holds thy courage from so brave a field?
  on some important message art thou bound,
  or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?
  inglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,
  and glows with prospects of th' approaching day.
   o prince!  meriones replies  whose care
  leads forth the embattled sons of crete to war
  this speaks my grief  this headless lance i wield
  the rest lies rooted in a trojan shield.
  to whom the cretan   enter, and receive
  the wonted weapons  those my tent can give
  spears i have store,  and trojan lances all,
  that shed a lustre round the illumined wall,
  though i, disdainful of the distant war,
  nor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,
  yet hand to hand i fight, and spoil the slain
  and thence these trophies, and these arms i gain.
  enter, and see on heaps the helmets roll'd,
  and high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold.
   nor vain  said merion  are our martial toils
  we too can boast of no ignoble spoils
  but those my ship contains  whence distant far,
  i fight conspicuous in the van of war,
  what need i more? if any greek there be
  who knows not merion, i appeal to thee.
  to this, idomeneus   the fields of fight
  have proved thy valour, and unconquer'd might
  and were some ambush for the foes design'd,
  even there thy courage would not lag behind
  in that sharp service, singled from the rest,
  the fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.
  no force, no firmness, the pale coward shows
  he shifts his place  his colour comes and goes
  a dropping sweat creeps cold on every part
  against his bosom beats his quivering heart
  terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare
  with chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,
  and looks a bloodless image of despair!
  not so the brave--still dauntless, still the same,
  unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame
  composed his thought, determined is his eye,
  and fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die
  if aught disturb the tenour of his breast,
  'tis but the wish to strike before the rest.
   in such assays thy blameless worth is known,
  and every art of dangerous war thy own.
  by chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,
  those wounds were glorious all, and all before
  such as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight
  t'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.
  but why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,
  stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?
  go--from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,
  and to their owners send them nobly back.
  swift at the word bold merion snatch'd a spear
  and, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.
  so mars armipotent invades the plain,
   the wide destroyer of the race of man,
  terror, his best-beloved son, attends his course,
  arm'd with stern boldness, and enormous force
  the pride of haughty warriors to confound,
  and lay the strength of tyrants on the ground
  from thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarms
  of warring phlegyans, and ephyrian arms
  invoked by both, relentless they dispose,
  to these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.
  so march'd the leaders of the cretan train,
  and their bright arms shot horror o'er the plain.
  then first spake merion   shall we join the right,
  or combat in the centre of the fight?
  or to the left our wonted succour lend?
  hazard and fame all parts alike attend.
   not in the centre  idomen replied
  our ablest chieftains the main battle guide
  each godlike ajax makes that post his care,
  and gallant teucer deals destruction there,
  skill'd or with shafts to gall the distant field,
  or bear close battle on the sounding shield.
  these can the rage of haughty hector tame
  safe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,
  till jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,
  and hurl the blazing ruin at our head.
  great must he be, of more than human birth,
  nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.
  him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,
  whom ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.
  in standing fight he mates achilles' force,
  excell'd alone in swiftness in the course.
  then to the left our ready arms apply,
  and live with glory, or with glory die.
  he said  and merion to th' appointed place,
  fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.
  soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld
  rush like a fiery torrent o'er the field,
  their force embodied in a tide they pour
  the rising combat sounds along the shore.
  as warring winds, in sirius' sultry reign,
  from different quarters sweep the sandy plain
  on every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,
  and the dry fields are lifted to the skies
  thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,
  met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken'd heaven.
  all dreadful glared the iron face of war,
  bristled with upright spears, that flash'd afar
  dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,
  and polish'd arms emblazed the flaming fields
  tremendous scene! that general horror gave,
  but touch'd with joy the bosoms of the brave.
  saturn's great sons in fierce contention vied,
  and crowds of heroes in their anger died.
  the sire of earth and heaven, by thetis won
  to crown with glory peleus' godlike son,
  will'd not destruction to the grecian powers,
  but spared awhile the destined trojan towers
  while neptune, rising from his azure main,
  warr'd on the king of heaven with stern disdain,
  and breathed revenge, and fired the grecian train.
  gods of one source, of one ethereal race,
  alike divine, and heaven their native place
  but jove the greater  first-born of the skies,
  and more than men, or gods, supremely wise.
  for this, of jove's superior might afraid,
  neptune in human form conceal'd his aid.
  these powers enfold the greek and trojan train
  in war and discord's adamantine chain,
  indissolubly strong  the fatal tie
  is stretch'd on both, and close compell'd they die.
  dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,
  the bold idomeneus controls the day.
  first by his hand othryoneus was slain,
  swell'd with false hopes, with mad ambition vain
  call'd by the voice of war to martial fame,
  from high cabesus' distant walls he came
  cassandra's love he sought, with boasts of power,
  and promised conquest was the proffer'd dower.
  the king consented, by his vaunts abused
  the king consented, but the fates refused.
  proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,
  the field he measured with a larger stride.
  him as he stalk'd, the cretan javelin found
  vain was his breastplate to repel the wound
  his dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell
  his arms resounded as the boaster fell.
  the great idomeneus bestrides the dead
   and thus  he cries  behold thy promise sped!
  such is the help thy arms to ilion bring,
  and such the contract of the phrygian king!
  our offers now, illustrious prince! receive
  for such an aid what will not argos give?
  to conquer troy, with ours thy forces join,
  and count atrides' fairest daughter thine.
  meantime, on further methods to advise,
  come, follow to the fleet thy new allies
  there hear what greece has on her part to say.
  he spoke, and dragg'd the gory corse away.
  this asius view'd, unable to contain,
  before his chariot warring on the plain
   his crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,
  impatient panted on his neck behind
  to vengeance rising with a sudden spring,
  he hoped the conquest of the cretan king.
  the wary cretan, as his foe drew near,
  full on his throat discharged the forceful spear
  beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,
  and glitter'd, extant at the further side.
  as when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,
  or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,
  groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,
  then spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground
  so sunk proud asius in that dreadful day,
  and stretch'd before his much-loved coursers lay.
  he grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore,
  and, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.
  deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,
  stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,
  nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,
  but falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey
  pierced by antilochus, he pants beneath
  the stately car, and labours out his breath.
  thus asius' steeds  their mighty master gone
  remain the prize of nestor's youthful son.
  stabb'd at the sight, deiphobus drew nigh,
  and made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.
  the cretan saw  and, stooping, caused to glance
  from his slope shield the disappointed lance.
  beneath the spacious targe,  a blazing round,
  thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,
  on his raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,
  he lay collected in defensive shade.
  o'er his safe head the javelin idly sung,
  and on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.
  even then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd,
  and pierced, obliquely, king hypsenor's breast
  warm'd in his liver, to the ground it bore
  the chief, his people's guardian now no more!
   not unattended  the proud trojan cries
  nor unrevenged, lamented asius lies
  for thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd,
  this mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.
  heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,
  touch'd every greek, but nestor's son the most.
  grieved as he was, his pious arms attend,
  and his broad buckler shields his slaughter'd friend
  till sad mecistheus and alastor bore
  his honour'd body to the tented shore.
  nor yet from fight idomeneus withdraws
  resolved to perish in his country's cause,
  or find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom
  to wail his fate in death's eternal gloom.
  he sees alcathous in the front aspire
  great  syetes was the hero's sire
  his spouse hippodame, divinely fair,
  anchises' eldest hope, and darling care
  who charm'd her parents' and her husband's heart
  with beauty, sense, and every work of art
  he once of ilion's youth the loveliest boy,
  the fairest she of all the fair of troy.
  by neptune now the hapless hero dies,
  who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,
  and fetters every limb  yet bent to meet
  his fate he stands  nor shuns the lance of crete.
  fix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,
  while the winds sleep  his breast received the stroke.
  before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,
  long used to ward the death in fighting fields.
  the riven armour sends a jarring sound
  his labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,
  the long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound
  fast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,
  life's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.
  then idomen, insulting o'er the slain
   behold, deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain
  see! on one greek three trojan ghosts attend
  this, my third victim, to the shades i send.
  approaching now thy boasted might approve,
  and try the prowess of the seed of jove.
  from jove, enamour'd of a mortal dame,
  great minos, guardian of his country, came
  deucalion, blameless prince, was minos' heir
  his first-born i, the third from jupiter
  o'er spacious crete, and her bold sons, i reign,
  and thence my ships transport me through the main
  lord of a host, o'er all my host i shine,
  a scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line.
  the trojan heard  uncertain or to meet,
  alone, with venturous arms the king of crete,
  or seek auxiliar force  at length decreed
  to call some hero to partake the deed,
  forthwith  neas rises to his thought
  for him in troy's remotest lines he sought,
  where he, incensed at partial priam, stands,
  and sees superior posts in meaner hands.
  to him, ambitious of so great an aid,
  the bold deiphobus approach'd, and said
   now, trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,
  if e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.
  alcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend
  come, and the warrior's loved remains defend.
  beneath his cares thy early youth was train'd,
  one table fed you, and one roof contain'd.
  this deed to fierce idomeneus we owe
  haste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe.
   neas heard, and for a space resign'd
  to tender pity all his manly mind
  then rising in his rage, he burns to fight
  the greek awaits him with collected might.
  as the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,
  arm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,
  when the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,
  attends the tumult, and expects the war
  o'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise
  fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,
  his foaming tusks both dogs and men engage
  but most his hunters rouse his mighty rage
  so stood idomeneus, his javelin shook,
  and met the trojan with a lowering look.
  antilochus, deipyrus, were near,
  the youthful offspring of the god of war,
  merion, and aphareus, in field renown'd
  to these the warrior sent his voice around.
   fellows in arms! your timely aid unite
  lo, great  neas rushes to the fight
  sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold
  he fresh in youth, and i in arms grown old.
  else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,
  the great dispute, of glory, or of life.
  he spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd
  their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade
  around the chief.  neas too demands
  th' assisting forces of his native bands
  paris, deiphobus, agenor, join
   co-aids and captains of the trojan line
  in order follow all th' embodied train,
  like ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain
  before his fleecy care, erect and bold,
  stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.
  with joy the swain surveys them, as he leads
  to the cool fountains, through the well-known meads
  so joys  neas, as his native band
  moves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.
  round dread alcathous now the battle rose
  on every side the steely circle grows
  now batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,
  and o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.
  above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,
  there great idomeneus,  neas here.
  like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,
  and burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.
  the trojan weapon whizz'd along in air
  the cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear
  sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood
  stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.
  but oenomas received the cretan's stroke
  the forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,
  it ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,
  and roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.
  stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,
  and, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.
  the victor from his breast the weapon tears
  his spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.
  though now unfit an active war to wage,
  heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,
  his listless limbs unable for the course,
  in standing fight he yet maintains his force
  till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,
  his tired slow steps he drags from off the field.
  deiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,
  and, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast
  the javelin err'd, but held its course along,
  and pierced ascalaphus, the brave and young
  the son of mars fell gasping on the ground,
  and gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.
  nor knew the furious father of his fall
  high-throned amidst the great olympian hall,
  on golden clouds th' immortal synod sate
  detain'd from bloody war by jove and fate.
  now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,
  for slain ascalaphus commenced the fray,
  deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,
  and from his temples rends the glittering prize
  valiant as mars, meriones drew near,
  and on his loaded arm discharged his spear
  he drops the weight, disabled with the pain
  the hollow helmet rings against the plain.
  swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,
  from his torn arm the grecian rent away
  the reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.
  his wounded brother good polites tends
  around his waist his pious arms he threw,
  and from the rage of battle gently drew
  him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,
  rapt from the lessening thunder of the war
  to troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,
  and sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.
  meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,
  heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.
  bold aphareus by great  neas bled
  as toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,
  he pierced his throat  the bending head, depress'd
  beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast
  his shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,
  and everlasting slumber seals his eyes.
  antilochus, as thoon turn'd him round,
  transpierced his back with a dishonest wound
  the hollow vein, that to the neck extends
  along the chine, his eager javelin rends
  supine he falls, and to his social train
  spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.
  th' exulting victor, leaping where he lay,
  from his broad shoulders tore the spoils away
  his time observed  for closed by foes around,
  on all sides thick the peals of arms resound.
  his shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,
  but he impervious and untouch'd remains.
   great neptune's care preserved from hostile rage
  this youth, the joy of nestor's glorious age.
  in arms intrepid, with the first he fought,
  faced every foe, and every danger sought
  his winged lance, resistless as the wind,
  obeys each motion of the master's mind!
  restless it flies, impatient to be free,
  and meditates the distant enemy.
  the son of asius, adamas, drew near,
  and struck his target with the brazen spear
  fierce in his front  but neptune wards the blow,
  and blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe
  in the broad buckler half the weapon stood,
  splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.
  disarm'd, he mingled in the trojan crew
  but merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,
  deep in the belly's rim an entrance found,
  where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.
  bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,
  lay panting. thus an ox in fetters tied,
  while death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,
  his bulk enormous on the field displays
  his heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.
  the spear the conqueror from his body drew,
  and death's dim shadows swarm before his view.
  next brave deipyrus in dust was laid
  king helenus waved high the thracian blade,
  and smote his temples with an arm so strong,
  the helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng
  there for some luckier greek it rests a prize
  for dark in death the godlike owner lies!
  raging with grief, great menelaus burns,
  and fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns
  that shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw
  and this stood adverse with the bended bow
  full on his breast the trojan arrow fell,
  but harmless bounded from the plated steel.
  as on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,
   the winds collected at each open door,
  while the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,
  light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground
  so from the steel that guards atrides' heart,
  repell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.
  atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,
  pierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.
  and nailed it to the yew  the wounded hand
  trail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand
  but good agenor gently from the wound
  the spear solicits, and the bandage bound
  a sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,
  at once the tent and ligature supplied.
  behold! pisander, urged by fate's decree,
  springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,
  great menelaus! to enchance thy fame
  high-towering in the front, the warrior came.
  first the sharp lance was by atrides thrown
  the lance far distant by the winds was blown.
  nor pierced pisander through atrides' shield
  pisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.
  not so discouraged, to the future blind,
  vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind
  dauntless he rushes where the spartan lord
  like lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.
  his left arm high opposed the shining shield
  his right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held
   an olive's cloudy grain the handle made,
  distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade
  this on the helm discharged a noble blow
  the plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,
  shorn from the crest. atrides waved his steel
  deep through his front the weighty falchion fell
  the crashing bones before its force gave way
  in dust and blood the groaning hero lay
  forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,
  the clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.
  and fierce atrides spurn'd him as he bled,
  tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said
   thus, trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear
  o race perfidious, who delight in war!
  already noble deeds ye have perform'd
  a princess raped transcends a navy storm'd
  in such bold feats your impious might approve,
  without th' assistance, or the fear of jove.
  the violated rites, the ravish'd dame
  our heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,
  crimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,
  and whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.
  o thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,
  above the thought of man, supremely wise!
  if from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,
  from whence this favour to an impious foe?
  a godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,
  still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?
  the best of things, beyond their measure, cloy
  sleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy
  the feast, the dance  whate'er mankind desire,
  even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.
  but troy for ever reaps a dire delight
  in thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.
  this said, he seized  while yet the carcase heaved
  the bloody armour, which his train received
  then sudden mix'd among the warring crew,
  and the bold son of pylaemenes slew.
  harpalion had through asia travell'd far,
  following his martial father to the war
  through filial love he left his native shore,
  never, ah, never to behold it more!
  his unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling
  against the target of the spartan king
  thus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,
  and turns around his apprehensive eyes.
  him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,
  the shaft of merion mingled with the dead.
  beneath the bone the glancing point descends,
  and, driving down, the swelling bladder rends
  sunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,
  and in short pantings sobb'd his soul away
   like some vile worm extended on the ground
  while life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.
  him on his car the paphlagonian train
  in slow procession bore from off the plain.
  the pensive father, father now no more!
  attends the mournful pomp along the shore
  and unavailing tears profusely shed
  and, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.
  paris from far the moving sight beheld,
  with pity soften'd and with fury swell'd
  his honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace,
  and loved of all the paphlagonian race!
  with his full strength he bent his angry bow,
  and wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.
  a chief there was, the brave euchenor named,
  for riches much, and more for virtue famed.
  who held his seat in corinth's stately town
  polydus' son, a seer of old renown.
  oft had the father told his early doom,
  by arms abroad, or slow disease at home
  he climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,
  and chose the certain glorious path to death.
  beneath his ear the pointed arrow went
  the soul came issuing at the narrow vent
  his limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,
  and everlasting darkness shades him round.
  nor knew great hector how his legions yield,
   wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field
  wide on the left the force of greece commands,
  and conquest hovers o'er th' achaian bands
  with such a tide superior virtue sway'd,
  and he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.
  but in the centre hector fix'd remain'd,
  where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd
  there, on the margin of the hoary deep,
   their naval station where the ajaces keep.
  and where low walls confine the beating tides,
  whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides
  where late in fight both foot and horse engaged,
  and all the thunder of the battle raged,
  there join'd, the whole boeotian strength remains,
  the proud iaonians with their sweeping trains,
  locrians and phthians, and th' epaean force
  but join'd, repel not hector's fiery course.
  the flower of athens, stichius, phidas, led
  bias and great menestheus at their head
  meges the strong the epaean bands controll'd,
  and dracius prudent, and amphion bold
  the phthians, medon, famed for martial might,
  and brave podarces, active in the fight.
  this drew from phylacus his noble line
  iphiclus' son  and that  oileus  thine
   young ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace
  he dwelt far distant from his native place,
  by his fierce step-dame from his father's reign
  expell'd and exiled for her brother slain
  these rule the phthians, and their arms employ,
  mix'd with boeotians, on the shores of troy.
  now side by side, with like unwearied care,
  each ajax laboured through the field of war
  so when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,
  force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,
  join'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,
  and trace large furrows with the shining share
  o'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,
  and streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.
  a train of heroes followed through the field,
  who bore by turns great ajax' sevenfold shield
  whene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,
  tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.
  no following troops his brave associate grace
  in close engagement an unpractised race,
  the locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,
  nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield
  but skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,
  or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,
  dexterous with these they aim a certain wound,
  or fell the distant warrior to the ground.
  thus in the van the telamonian train,
  throng'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain
  far in the rear the locrian archers lie,
  whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,
  the mingled tempest on the foes they pour
  troy's scattering orders open to the shower.
  now had the greeks eternal fame acquired,
  and the gall'd ilians to their walls retired
  but sage polydamas, discreetly brave,
  address'd great hector, and this counsel gave
   though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend
  impartial audience to a faithful friend
  to gods and men thy matchless worth is known,
  and every art of glorious war thy own
  but in cool thought and counsel to excel,
  how widely differs this from warring well!
  content with what the bounteous gods have given,
  seek not alone to engross the gifts of heaven.
  to some the powers of bloody war belong,
  to some sweet music and the charm of song
  to few, and wondrous few, has jove assign'd
  a wise, extensive, all-considering mind
  their guardians these, the nations round confess,
  and towns and empires for their safety bless.
  if heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,
  attend, o hector! what i judge the best,
  see, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,
  and war's whole fury burns around thy head.
  behold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,
  how many trojans yield, disperse, or fall!
  what troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!
  and what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!
  here cease thy fury  and, the chiefs and kings
  convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.
  whether  the gods succeeding our desires
  to yon tall ships to bear the trojan fires
  or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,
  contented with the conquest of the day.
  i fear, i fear, lest greece, not yet undone,
  pay the large debt of last revolving sun
  achilles, great achilles, yet remains
  on yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!
  the counsel pleased  and hector, with a bound,
  leap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground
  swift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.
   to guard this post  he cried  thy art employ,
  and here detain the scatter'd youth of troy
  where yonder heroes faint, i bend my way,
  and hasten back to end the doubtful day.
  this said, the towering chief prepares to go,
  shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,
  and seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.
  through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,
  and bids anew the martial thunder rise.
  to panthus' son, at hector's high command
  haste the bold leaders of the trojan band
  but round the battlements, and round the plain,
  for many a chief he look'd, but look'd in vain
  deiphobus, nor helenus the seer,
  nor asius' son, nor asius' self appear
  for these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,
  some cold in death, some groaning on the ground
  some low in dust,  a mournful object  lay
  high on the wall some breathed their souls away.
  far on the left, amid the throng he found
   cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around
  the graceful paris  whom, with fury moved,
  opprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved
   ill-fated paris! slave to womankind,
  as smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!
  where is deiphobus, where asius gone?
  the godlike father, and th' intrepid son?
  the force of helenus, dispensing fate
  and great othryoneus, so fear'd of late?
  black fate hang's o'er thee from th' avenging gods,
  imperial troy from her foundations nods
  whelm'd in thy country's ruin shalt thou fall,
  and one devouring vengeance swallow all.
  when paris thus   my brother and my friend,
  thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,
  in other battles i deserved thy blame,
  though then not deedless, nor unknown to fame
  but since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,
  i scatter'd slaughter from my fatal bow.
  the chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain
  of all those heroes, two alone remain
  deiphobus, and helenus the seer,
  each now disabled by a hostile spear.
  go then, successful, where thy soul inspires
  this heart and hand shall second all thy fires
  what with this arm i can, prepare to know,
  till death for death be paid, and blow for blow.
  but 'tis not ours, with forces not our own
  to combat  strength is of the gods alone.
  these words the hero's angry mind assuage
  then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.
  around polydamas, distain'd with blood,
  cebrion, phalces, stern orthaeus stood,
  palmus, with polypoetes the divine,
  and two bold brothers of hippotion's line
   who reach'd fair ilion, from ascania far,
  the former day  the next engaged in war .
  as when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs,
  that bears jove's thunder on its dreadful wings,
  wide o'er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps
  then, gather'd, settles on the hoary deeps
  the afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar
  the waves behind impel the waves before,
  wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore
  thus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng,
  chief urged on chief, and man drove man along.
  far o'er the plains, in dreadful order bright,
  the brazen arms reflect a beamy light
  full in the blazing van great hector shined,
  like mars commission'd to confound mankind.
  before him flaming his enormous shield,
  like the broad sun, illumined all the field
  his nodding helm emits a streamy ray
  his piercing eyes through all the battle stray,
  and, while beneath his targe he flash'd along,
  shot terrors round, that wither'd e'en the strong.
  thus stalk'd he, dreadful  death was in his look
  whole nations fear'd  but not an argive shook.
  the towering ajax, with an ample stride,
  advanced the first, and thus the chief defied
   hector! come on  thy empty threats forbear
  'tis not thy arm, 'tis thundering jove we fear
  the skill of war to us not idly given,
  lo! greece is humbled, not by troy, but heaven.
  vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,
  to force our fleet  the greeks have hands and hearts.
  long ere in flames our lofty navy fall,
  your boasted city, and your god-built wall,
  shall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground
  and spread a long unmeasured ruin round.
  the time shall come, when, chased along the plain,
  even thou shalt call on jove, and call in vain
  even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,
  the wings of falcons for thy flying horse
  shalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame,
  while clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame.
  as thus he spoke, behold, in open view,
  on sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.
  to jove's glad omen all the grecians rise,
  and hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies
  far-echoing clamours bound from side to side
  they ceased  and thus the chief of troy replied
   from whence this menace, this insulting strain?
  enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.
  so may the gods on hector life bestow,
   not that short life which mortals lead below,
  but such as those of jove's high lineage born,
  the blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,
  as this decisive day shall end the fame
  of greece, and argos be no more a name.
  and thou, imperious! if thy madness wait
  the lance of hector, thou shalt meet thy fate
  that giant-corse, extended on the shore,
  shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore.
  he said  and like a lion stalk'd along
  with shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,
  sent from his following host  the grecian train
  with answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain
  a shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above,
  shook the fix'd splendours of the throne of jove.
  but not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,
  could charm the cares of nestor's watchful soul
  his startled ears the increasing cries attend
  then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend
   what new alarm, divine machaon, say,
  what mix'd events attend this mighty day?
  hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,
  and now come full, and thicken to the fleet!
  here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,
  let hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,
  refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore
  while i the adventures of the day explore.
  he said  and, seizing thrasymedes' shield,
   his valiant offspring,  hasten'd to the field
   that day the son his father's buckler bore
  then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door.
  soon as the prospect open'd to his view,
  his wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew
  dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,
  the wall in ruins, and the greeks in flight.
  as when old ocean's silent surface sleeps,
  the waves just heaving on the purple deeps
  while yet the expected tempest hangs on high,
  weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,
  the mass of waters will no wind obey
  jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.
  while wavering counsels thus his mind engage,
  fluctuates in doubtful thought the pylian sage,
  to join the host, or to the general haste
  debating long, he fixes on the last
  yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,
  the field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,
  the gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly
  blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.
  him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,
  by tardy steps ascending from the fleet
  the king of men, ulysses the divine,
  and who to tydeus owes his noble line.
   their ships at distance from the battle stand,
  in lines advanced along the shelving strand
  whose bay, the fleet unable to contain
  at length  beside the margin of the main,
  rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor
  who landed first, lay highest on the shore.
  supported on the spears, they took their way,
  unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.
  nestor's approach alarm'd each grecian breast,
  whom thus the general of the host address'd
   o grace and glory of the achaian name
  what drives thee, nestor, from the field of fame?
  shall then proud hector see his boast fulfill'd,
  our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill'd?
  such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,
  on many a grecian bosom writ in blood.
  is every heart inflamed with equal rage
  against your king, nor will one chief engage?
  and have i lived to see with mournful eyes
  in every greek a new achilles rise?
  gerenian nestor then   so fate has will'd
  and all-confirming time has fate fulfill'd.
  not he that thunders from the aerial bower,
  not jove himself, upon the past has power.
  the wall, our late inviolable bound,
  and best defence, lies smoking on the ground
  even to the ships their conquering arms extend,
  and groans of slaughter'd greeks to heaven ascend.
  on speedy measures then employ your thought
  in such distress! if counsel profit aught
  arms cannot much  though mars our souls incite,
  these gaping wounds withhold us from the fight.
  to him the monarch   that our army bends,
  that troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,
  and that the rampart, late our surest trust
  and best defence, lies smoking in the dust
  all this from jove's afflictive hand we bear,
  who, far from argos, wills our ruin here.
  past are the days when happier greece was blest,
  and all his favour, all his aid confess'd
  now heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,
  and lifts the trojan glory to the skies.
  cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,
  and launch what ships lie nearest to the main
  leave these at anchor, till the coming night
  then, if impetuous troy forbear the fight,
  bring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.
  better from evils, well foreseen, to run,
  than perish in the danger we may shun.
  thus he. the sage ulysses thus replies,
  while anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes
   what shameful words  unkingly as thou art
  fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?
  oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,
  and thou the shame of any host but ours!
  a host, by jove endued with martial might,
  and taught to conquer, or to fall in fight
  adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,
  employ'd our youth, and yet employs our age.
  and wilt thou thus desert the trojan plain?
  and have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?
  in such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,
  speak it in whispers, lest a greek should hear.
  lives there a man so dead to fame, who dares
  to think such meanness, or the thought declares?
  and comes it even from him whose sovereign sway
  the banded legions of all greece obey?
  is this a general's voice that calls to flight,
  while war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?
  what more could troy? what yet their fate denies
  thou givest the foe  all greece becomes their prize.
  no more the troops  our hoisted sails in view,
  themselves abandon'd  shall the fight pursue
  but thy ships flying, with despair shall see
  and owe destruction to a prince like thee.
   thy just reproofs  atrides calm replies
  like arrows pierce me, for thy words are wise.
  unwilling as i am to lose the host,
  i force not greece to quit this hateful coast
  glad i submit, whoe'er, or young, or old,
  aught, more conducive to our weal, unfold.
  tydides cut him short, and thus began
   such counsel if you seek, behold the man
  who boldly gives it, and what he shall say,
  young though he be, disdain not to obey
  a youth, who from the mighty tydeus springs,
  may speak to councils and assembled kings.
  hear then in me the great oenides' son,
  whose honoured dust  his race of glory run
  lies whelm'd in ruins of the theban wall
  brave in his life, and glorious in his fall.
  with three bold sons was generous prothous bless'd,
  who pleuron's walls and calydon possess'd
  melas and agrius, but  who far surpass'd
  the rest in courage  oeneus was the last.
  from him, my sire. from calydon expell'd,
  he pass'd to argos, and in exile dwell'd
  the monarch's daughter there  so jove ordain'd
  he won, and flourish'd where adrastus reign'd
  there, rich in fortune's gifts, his acres till'd,
  beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,
  and numerous flocks that whiten'd all the field.
  such tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!
  nor lives in greece a stranger to his name.
  then, what for common good my thoughts inspire,
  attend, and in the son respect the sire.
  though sore of battle, though with wounds oppress'd,
  let each go forth, and animate the rest,
  advance the glory which he cannot share,
  though not partaker, witness of the war.
  but lest new wounds on wounds o'erpower us quite,
  beyond the missile javelin's sounding flight,
  safe let us stand  and, from the tumult far,
  inspire the ranks, and rule the distant war.
  he added not  the listening kings obey,
  slow moving on  atrides leads the way.
  the god of ocean  to inflame their rage
  appears a warrior furrowed o'er with age
  press'd in his own, the general's hand he took,
  and thus the venerable hero spoke
   atrides! lo! with what disdainful eye
  achilles sees his country's forces fly
  blind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,
  who glories in unutterable pride.
  so may he perish, so may jove disclaim
  the wretch relentless, and o'erwhelm with shame!
  but heaven forsakes not thee  o'er yonder sands
  soon shall thou view the scattered trojan bands
  fly diverse  while proud kings, and chiefs renown'd,
  driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around
  of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ
  to hide their ignominious heads in troy.
  he spoke, then rush'd amid the warrior crew,
  and sent his voice before him as he flew,
  loud, as the shout encountering armies yield
  when twice ten thousand shake the labouring field
  such was the voice, and such the thundering sound
  of him whose trident rends the solid ground.
  each argive bosom beats to meet the fight,
  and grisly war appears a pleasing sight.
  meantime saturnia from olympus' brow,
  high-throned in gold, beheld the fields below
  with joy the glorious conflict she survey'd,
  where her great brother gave the grecians aid.
  but placed aloft, on ida's shady height
  she sees her jove, and trembles at the sight.
  jove to deceive, what methods shall she try,
  what arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?
  at length she trusts her power  resolved to prove
  the old, yet still successful, cheat of love
  against his wisdom to oppose her charms,
  and lull the lord of thunders in her arms.
  swift to her bright apartment she repairs,
  sacred to dress and beauty's pleasing cares
  with skill divine had vulcan form'd the bower,
  safe from access of each intruding power.
  touch'd with her secret key, the doors unfold
  self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.
  here first she bathes  and round her body pours
  soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers
  the winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey
  through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way
  spirit divine! whose exhalation greets
  the sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.
  thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride
  her artful hands the radiant tresses tied
  part on her head in shining ringlets roll'd,
  part o'er her shoulders waved like melted gold.
  around her next a heavenly mantle flow'd,
  that rich with pallas' labour'd colours glow'd
  large clasps of gold the foldings gather'd round,
  a golden zone her swelling bosom bound.
  far-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,
  each gem illumined with a triple star.
  then o'er her head she cast a veil more white
  than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.
  last her fair feet celestial sandals grace.
  thus issuing radiant with majestic pace,
  forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves,
  and calls the mother of the smiles and loves.
   how long  to venus thus apart she cried
  shall human strife celestial minds divide?
  ah yet, will venus aid saturnia's joy,
  and set aside the cause of greece and troy?
   let heaven's dread empress  cytheraea said
  speak her request, and deem her will obey'd.
   then grant me  said the queen  those conquering charms,
  that power, which mortals and immortals warms,
  that love, which melts mankind in fierce desires,
  and burns the sons of heaven with sacred fires!
   for lo! i haste to those remote abodes,
  where the great parents,  sacred source of gods!
  ocean and tethys their old empire keep,
  on the last limits of the land and deep.
  in their kind arms my tender years were past
  what time old saturn, from olympus cast,
  of upper heaven to jove resign'd the reign,
  whelm'd under the huge mass of earth and main.
  for strife, i hear, has made the union cease,
  which held so long that ancient pair in peace.
  what honour, and what love, shall i obtain,
  if i compose those fatal feuds again
  once more their minds in mutual ties engage,
  and, what my youth has owed, repay their age!
  she said. with awe divine, the queen of love
  obey'd the sister and the wife of jove
  and from her fragrant breast the zone embraced,
  with various skill and high embroidery graced.
  in this was every art, and every charm,
  to win the wisest, and the coldest warm
  fond love, the gentle vow, the gay desire,
  the kind deceit, the still-reviving fire,
  persuasive speech, and the more persuasive sighs,
  silence that spoke, and eloquence of eyes.
  this on her hand the cyprian goddess laid
   take this, and with it all thy wish   she said.
  with smiles she took the charm  and smiling press'd
  the powerful cestus to her snowy breast.
  then venus to the courts of jove withdrew
  whilst from olympus pleased saturnia flew.
  o'er high pieria thence her course she bore,
  o'er fair emathia's ever-pleasing shore,
  o'er hemus' hills with snows eternal crown'd
  nor once her flying foot approach'd the ground.
  then taking wing from athos' lofty steep,
  she speeds to lemnos o'er the rolling deep,
  and seeks the cave of death's half-brother, sleep.
   sweet pleasing sleep!  saturnia thus began
  who spread'st thy empire o'er each god and man
  if e'er obsequious to thy juno's will,
  o power of slumbers! hear, and favour still.
  shed thy soft dews on jove's immortal eyes,
  while sunk in love's entrancing joys he lies.
  a splendid footstool, and a throne, that shine
  with gold unfading, somnus, shall be thine
  the work of vulcan  to indulge thy ease,
  when wine and feasts thy golden humours please.
   imperial dame  the balmy power replies ,
  great saturn's heir, and empress of the skies!
  o'er other gods i spread my easy chain
  the sire of all, old ocean, owns my reign.
  and his hush'd waves lie silent on the main.
  but how, unbidden, shall i dare to steep
  jove's awful temples in the dew of sleep?
  long since, too venturous, at thy bold command,
  on those eternal lids i laid my hand
  what time, deserting ilion's wasted plain,
  his conquering son, alcides, plough'd the main.
  when lo! the deeps arise, the tempests roar,
  and drive the hero to the coan shore
  great jove, awaking, shook the blest abodes
  with rising wrath, and tumbled gods on gods
  me chief he sought, and from the realms on high
  had hurl'd indignant to the nether sky,
  but gentle night, to whom i fled for aid,
   the friend of earth and heaven,  her wings display'd
  impower'd the wrath of gods and men to tame,
  even jove revered the venerable dame.
   vain are thy fears  the queen of heaven replies,
  and, speaking, rolls her large majestic eyes
  think'st thou that troy has jove's high favour won,
  like great alcides, his all-conquering son?
  hear, and obey the mistress of the skies,
  nor for the deed expect a vulgar prize
  for know, thy loved-one shall be ever thine,
  the youngest grace, pasithae the divine.
   swear then  he said  by those tremendous floods
  that roar through hell, and bind the invoking gods
  let the great parent earth one hand sustain,
  and stretch the other o'er the sacred main
  call the black titans, that with chronos dwell,
  to hear and witness from the depths of hell
  that she, my loved-one, shall be ever mine,
  the youngest grace, pasithae the divine.
  the queen assents, and from the infernal bowers
  invokes the sable subtartarean powers,
  and those who rule the inviolable floods,
  whom mortals name the dread titanian gods.
  then swift as wind, o'er lemnos' smoky isle
  they wing their way, and imbrus' sea-beat soil
  through air, unseen, involved in darkness glide,
  and light on lectos, on the point of ide
   mother of savages, whose echoing hills
  are heard resounding with a hundred rills
  fair ida trembles underneath the god
  hush'd are her mountains, and her forests nod.
  there on a fir, whose spiry branches rise
  to join its summit to the neighbouring skies
  dark in embowering shade, conceal'd from sight,
  sat sleep, in likeness of the bird of night.
   chalcis his name by those of heavenly birth,
  but call'd cymindis by the race of earth.
  to ida's top successful juno flies
  great jove surveys her with desiring eyes
  the god, whose lightning sets the heavens on fire,
  through all his bosom feels the fierce desire
  fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charms,
  mix'd with her soul, and melted in her arms
  fix'd on her eyes he fed his eager look,
  then press'd her hand, and thus with transport spoke
   why comes my goddess from the ethereal sky,
  and not her steeds and flaming chariot nigh?
  then she-- i haste to those remote abodes
  where the great parents of the deathless gods,
  the reverend ocean and gray tethys, reign,
  on the last limits of the land and main.
  i visit these, to whose indulgent cares
  i owe the nursing of my tender years
  for strife, i hear, has made that union cease
  which held so long that ancient pair in peace.
  the steeds, prepared my chariot to convey
  o'er earth and seas, and through the aerial way,
  wait under ide  of thy superior power
  to ask consent, i leave the olympian bower
  nor seek, unknown to thee, the sacred cells
  deep under seas, where hoary ocean dwells.
   for that  said jove  suffice another day!
  but eager love denies the least delay.
  let softer cares the present hour employ,
  and be these moments sacred all to joy.
  ne'er did my soul so strong a passion prove,
  or for an earthly, or a heavenly love
  not when i press'd ixion's matchless dame,
  whence rose pirithous like the gods in fame
  not when fair danae felt the shower of gold
  stream into life, whence perseus brave and bold.
  not thus i burn'd for either theban dame
   bacchus from this, from that alcides came
  nor phoenix' daughter, beautiful and young,
  whence godlike rhadamanth and minos sprung.
  not thus i burn'd for fair latona's face,
  nor comelier ceres' more majestic grace.
  not thus even for thyself i felt desire,
  as now my veins receive the pleasing fire.
  he spoke  the goddess with the charming eyes
  glows with celestial red, and thus replies
   is this a scene for love? on ida's height,
  exposed to mortal and immortal sight!
  our joys profaned by each familiar eye
  the sport of heaven, and fable of the sky
  how shall i e'er review the blest abodes,
  or mix among the senate of the gods?
  shall i not think, that, with disorder'd charms,
  all heaven beholds me recent from thy arms?
  with skill divine has vulcan form'd thy bower,
  sacred to love and to the genial hour
  if such thy will, to that recess retire,
  in secret there indulge thy soft desire.
  she ceased  and, smiling with superior love,
  thus answer'd mild the cloud-compelling jove
   nor god nor mortal shall our joys behold,
  shaded with clouds, and circumfused in gold
  not even the sun, who darts through heaven his rays,
  and whose broad eye the extended earth surveys.
  gazing he spoke, and, kindling at the view,
  his eager arms around the goddess threw.
  glad earth perceives, and from her bosom pours
  unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers
  thick new-born violets a soft carpet spread,
  and clustering lotos swell'd the rising bed,
  and sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow,
  and flamy crocus made the mountain glow
  there golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair,
  steep'd in soft joys and circumfused with air
  celestial dews, descending o'er the ground,
  perfume the mount, and breathe ambrosia round
  at length, with love and sleep's soft power oppress'd,
  the panting thunderer nods, and sinks to rest.
  now to the navy borne on silent wings,
  to neptune's ear soft sleep his message brings
  beside him sudden, unperceived, he stood,
  and thus with gentle words address'd the god
   now, neptune! now, the important hour employ,
  to check a while the haughty hopes of troy
  while jove yet rests, while yet my vapours shed
  the golden vision round his sacred head
  for juno's love, and somnus' pleasing ties,
  have closed those awful and eternal eyes.
  thus having said, the power of slumber flew,
  on human lids to drop the balmy dew.
  neptune, with zeal increased, renews his care,
  and towering in the foremost ranks of war,
  indignant thus-- oh once of martial fame!
  o greeks! if yet ye can deserve the name!
  this half-recover'd day shall troy obtain?
  shall hector thunder at your ships again?
  lo! still he vaunts, and threats the fleet with fires,
  while stern achilles in his wrath retires.
  one hero's loss too tamely you deplore,
  be still yourselves, and ye shall need no more.
  oh yet, if glory any bosom warms,
  brace on your firmest helms, and stand to arms
  his strongest spear each valiant grecian wield,
  each valiant grecian seize his broadest shield
  let to the weak the lighter arms belong,
  the ponderous targe be wielded by the strong.
  thus arm'd, not hector shall our presence stay
  myself, ye greeks! myself will lead the way.
  the troops assent  their martial arms they change
  the busy chiefs their banded legions range.
  the kings, though wounded, and oppress'd with pain,
  with helpful hands themselves assist the train.
  the strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield,
  the weaker warrior takes a lighter shield.
  thus sheath'd in shining brass, in bright array
  the legions march, and neptune leads the way
  his brandish'd falchion flames before their eyes,
  like lightning flashing through the frighted skies.
  clad in his might, the earth-shaking power appears
  pale mortals tremble, and confess their fears.
  troy's great defender stands alone unawed,
  arms his proud host, and dares oppose a god
  and lo! the god, and wondrous man, appear
  the sea's stern ruler there, and hector here.
  the roaring main, at her great master's call,
  rose in huge ranks, and form'd a watery wall
  around the ships  seas hanging o'er the shores,
  both armies join  earth thunders, ocean roars.
  not half so loud the bellowing deeps resound,
  when stormy winds disclose the dark profound
  less loud the winds that from the  olian hall
  roar through the woods, and make whole forests fall
  less loud the woods, when flames in torrents pour,
  catch the dry mountain, and its shades devour
  with such a rage the meeting hosts are driven,
  and such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven.
  the first bold javelin, urged by hector's force,
  direct at ajax' bosom winged its course
  but there no pass the crossing belts afford,
   one braced his shield, and one sustain'd his sword.
  then back the disappointed trojan drew,
  and cursed the lance that unavailing flew
  but 'scaped not ajax  his tempestuous hand
  a ponderous stone upheaving from the sand,
   where heaps laid loose beneath the warrior's feet,
  or served to ballast, or to prop the fleet,
  toss'd round and round, the missive marble flings
  on the razed shield the fallen ruin rings,
  full on his breast and throat with force descends
  nor deaden'd there its giddy fury spends,
  but whirling on, with many a fiery round,
  smokes in the dust, and ploughs into the ground.
  as when the bolt, red-hissing from above,
  darts on the consecrated plant of jove,
  the mountain-oak in flaming ruin lies,
  black from the blow, and smokes of sulphur rise
  stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand,
  and own the terrors of the almighty hand!
  so lies great hector prostrate on the shore
  his slacken'd hand deserts the lance it bore
  his following shield the fallen chief o'erspread
  beneath his helmet dropp'd his fainting head
  his load of armour, sinking to the ground,
  clanks on the field, a dead and hollow sound.
  loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain
  greece sees, in hope, troy's great defender slain
  all spring to seize him  storms of arrows fly,
  and thicker javelins intercept the sky.
  in vain an iron tempest hisses round
  he lies protected, and without a wound.
  polydamas, agenor the divine,
  the pious warrior of anchises' line,
  and each bold leader of the lycian band,
  with covering shields  a friendly circle  stand,
  his mournful followers, with assistant care,
  the groaning hero to his chariot bear
  his foaming coursers, swifter than the wind,
  speed to the town, and leave the war behind.
  when now they touch'd the mead's enamell'd side,
  where gentle xanthus rolls his easy tide,
  with watery drops the chief they sprinkle round,
  placed on the margin of the flowery ground.
  raised on his knees, he now ejects the gore
  now faints anew, low-sinking on the shore
  by fits he breathes, half views the fleeting skies,
  and seals again, by fits, his swimming eyes.
  soon as the greeks the chief's retreat beheld,
  with double fury each invades the field.
  oilean ajax first his javelin sped,
  pierced by whose point the son of enops bled
   satnius the brave, whom beauteous neis bore
  amidst her flocks on satnio's silver shore
  struck through the belly's rim, the warrior lies
  supine, and shades eternal veil his eyes.
  an arduous battle rose around the dead
  by turns the greeks, by turns the trojans bled.
  fired with revenge, polydamas drew near,
  and at prothoenor shook the trembling spear
  the driving javelin through his shoulder thrust,
  he sinks to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
   lo thus  the victor cries  we rule the field,
  and thus their arms the race of panthus wield
  from this unerring hand there flies no dart
  but bathes its point within a grecian heart.
  propp'd on that spear to which thou owest thy fall,
  go, guide thy darksome steps to pluto's dreary hall.
  he said, and sorrow touch'd each argive breast
  the soul of ajax burn'd above the rest.
  as by his side the groaning warrior fell,
  at the fierce foe he launch'd his piercing steel
  the foe, reclining, shunn'd the flying death
  but fate, archilochus, demands thy breath
  thy lofty birth no succour could impart,
  the wings of death o'ertook thee on the dart
  swift to perform heaven's fatal will, it fled
  full on the juncture of the neck and head,
  and took the joint, and cut the nerves in twain
  the dropping head first tumbled on the plain.
  so just the stroke, that yet the body stood
  erect, then roll'd along the sands in blood.
   here, proud polydamas, here turn thy eyes!
   the towering ajax loud-insulting cries
  say, is this chief extended on the plain
  a worthy vengeance for prothoenor slain?
  mark well his port! his figure and his face
  nor speak him vulgar, nor of vulgar race
  some lines, methinks, may make his lineage known,
  antenor's brother, or perhaps his son.
  he spake, and smiled severe, for well he knew
  the bleeding youth  troy sadden'd at the view.
  but furious acamas avenged his cause
  as promachus his slaughtered brother draws,
  he pierced his heart-- such fate attends you all,
  proud argives! destined by our arms to fall.
  not troy alone, but haughty greece, shall share
  the toils, the sorrows, and the wounds of war.
  behold your promachus deprived of breath,
  a victim owed to my brave brother's death.
  not unappeased he enters pluto's gate,
  who leaves a brother to revenge his fate.
  heart-piercing anguish struck the grecian host,
  but touch'd the breast of bold peneleus most
  at the proud boaster he directs his course
  the boaster flies, and shuns superior force.
  but young ilioneus received the spear
  ilioneus, his father's only care
   phorbas the rich, of all the trojan train
  whom hermes loved, and taught the arts of gain
  full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall,
  and from the fibres scoop'd the rooted ball,
  drove through the neck, and hurl'd him to the plain
  he lifts his miserable arms in vain!
  swift his broad falchion fierce peneleus spread,
  and from the spouting shoulders struck his head
  to earth at once the head and helmet fly
  the lance, yet sticking through the bleeding eye,
  the victor seized  and, as aloft he shook
  the gory visage, thus insulting spoke
   trojans! your great ilioneus behold!
  haste, to his father let the tale be told
  let his high roofs resound with frantic woe,
  such as the house of promachus must know
  let doleful tidings greet his mother's ear,
  such as to promachus' sad spouse we bear,
  when we victorious shall to greece return,
  and the pale matron in our triumphs mourn.
  dreadful he spoke, then toss'd the head on high
  the trojans hear, they tremble, and they fly
  aghast they gaze around the fleet and wall,
  and dread the ruin that impends on all.
  daughters of jove! that on olympus shine,
  ye all-beholding, all-recording nine!
  o say, when neptune made proud ilion yield,
  what chief, what hero first embrued the field?
  of all the grecians what immortal name,
  and whose bless'd trophies, will ye raise to fame?
  thou first, great ajax! on the unsanguined plain
  laid hyrtius, leader of the mysian train.
  phalces and mermer, nestor's son o'erthrew,
  bold merion, morys and hippotion slew.
  strong periphaetes and prothoon bled,
  by teucer's arrows mingled with the dead,
  pierced in the flank by menelaus' steel,
  his people's pastor, hyperenor fell
  eternal darkness wrapp'd the warrior round,
  and the fierce soul came rushing through the wound.
  but stretch'd in heaps before oileus' son,
  fall mighty numbers, mighty numbers run
  ajax the less, of all the grecian race
  skill'd in pursuit, and swiftest in the chase.
  now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,
  and many a chief lay gasping on the ground
  then stopp'd and panted, where the chariots lie
  fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.
  meanwhile, awaken'd from his dream of love,
  on ida's summit sat imperial jove
  round the wide fields he cast a careful view,
  there saw the trojans fly, the greeks pursue
  these proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain
  and, 'midst the war, the monarch of the main.
  not far, great hector on the dust he spies,
   his sad associates round with weeping eyes,
  ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,
  his senses wandering to the verge of death.
  the god beheld him with a pitying look,
  and thus, incensed, to fraudful juno spoke
   o thou, still adverse to the eternal will,
  for ever studious in promoting ill!
  thy arts have made the godlike hector yield,
  and driven his conquering squadrons from the field.
  canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand
  our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?
  hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high,
  from the vast concave of the spangled sky,
  i hung thee trembling in a golden chain,
  and all the raging gods opposed in vain?
  headlong i hurl'd them from the olympian hall,
  stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.
  for godlike hercules these deeds were done,
  nor seem'd the vengeance worthy such a son
  when, by thy wiles induced, fierce boreas toss'd
  the shipwreck'd hero on the coan coast,
  him through a thousand forms of death i bore,
  and sent to argos, and his native shore.
  hear this, remember, and our fury dread,
  nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head
  lest arts and blandishments successless prove,
  thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love.
  the thunderer spoke  imperial juno mourn'd,
  and, trembling, these submissive words return'd
   by every oath that powers immortal ties,
  the foodful earth and all-infolding skies
  by thy black waves, tremendous styx! that flow
  through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below
  by the dread honours of thy sacred head,
  and that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!
  not by my arts the ruler of the main
  steeps troy in blood, and ranges round the plain
  by his own ardour, his own pity sway'd,
  to help his greeks, he fought and disobey'd
  else had thy juno better counsels given,
  and taught submission to the sire of heaven.
   think'st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!
   the immortal father with a smile replies
  then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,
  nor dare to act but when we point the way.
  if truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will
  to yon bright synod on the olympian hill
  our high decree let various iris know,
  and call the god that bears the silver bow.
  let her descend, and from the embattled plain
  command the sea-god to his watery reign
  while phoebus hastes great hector to prepare
  to rise afresh, and once more wake the war
  his labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,
  and calls his senses from the verge of death.
  greece chased by troy, even to achilles' fleet,
  shall fall by thousands at the hero's feet.
  he, not untouch'd with pity, to the plain
  shall send patroclus, but shall send in vain.
  what youths he slaughters under ilion's walls!
  even my loved son, divine sarpedon, falls!
  vanquish'd at last by hector's lance he lies.
  then, nor till then, shall great achilles rise
  and lo! that instant, godlike hector dies.
  from that great hour the war's whole fortune turns,
  pallas assists, and lofty ilion burns.
  not till that day shall jove relax his rage,
  nor one of all the heavenly host engage
  in aid of greece. the promise of a god
  i gave, and seal'd it with the almighty nod,
  achilles' glory to the stars to raise
  such was our word, and fate the word obeys.
  the trembling queen  the almighty order given
  swift from the idaean summit shot to heaven.
  as some wayfaring man, who wanders o'er
  in thought a length of lands he trod before,
  sends forth his active mind from place to place,
  joins hill to dale, and measures space with space
  so swift flew juno to the bless'd abodes,
  if thought of man can match the speed of gods.
  there sat the powers in awful synod placed
  they bow'd, and made obeisance as she pass'd
  through all the brazen dome  with goblets crown'd
  they hail her queen  the nectar streams around.
  fair themis first presents the golden bowl,
  and anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?
  to whom the white-arm'd goddess thus replies
   enough thou know'st the tyrant of the skies,
  severely bent his purpose to fulfil,
  unmoved his mind, and unrestrain'd his will.
  go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call
  bid the crown'd nectar circle round the hall
  but jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome
  such stern decrees, such threaten'd woes to come,
  as soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,
  and damp the eternal banquets of the skies.
  the goddess said, and sullen took her place
  black horror sadden'd each celestial face.
  to see the gathering grudge in every breast,
  smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express'd
  while on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,
  sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.
  thus she proceeds-- attend, ye powers above!
  but know, 'tis madness to contest with jove
  supreme he sits  and sees, in pride of sway.
  your vassal godheads grudgingly obey
  fierce in the majesty of power controls
  shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.
  submiss, immortals! all he wills, obey
  and thou, great mars, begin and show the way.
  behold ascalaphus! behold him die,
  but dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh
  thy own loved boasted offspring lies o'erthrown,
  if that loved boasted offspring be thy own.
  stern mars, with anguish for his slaughter'd son,
  smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun
   thus then, immortals! thus shall mars obey
  forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way
  descending first to yon forbidden plain,
  the god of battles dares avenge the slain
  dares, though the thunder bursting o'er my head
  should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead.
  with that he gives command to fear and flight
  to join his rapid coursers for the fight
  then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies
  arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.
  and now had jove, by bold rebellion driven,
  discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven
  but pallas, springing through the bright abode,
  starts from her azure throne to calm the god.
  struck for the immortal race with timely fear,
  from frantic mars she snatch'd the shield and spear
  then the huge helmet lifting from his head,
  thus to the impetuous homicide she said
   by what wild passion, furious! art thou toss'd?
  striv'st thou with jove? thou art already lost.
  shall not the thunderer's dread command restrain,
  and was imperial juno heard in vain?
  back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,
  and in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?
  ilion and greece no more should jove engage,
  the skies would yield an ampler scene of rage
  guilty and guiltless find an equal fate
  and one vast ruin whelm the olympian state.
  cease then thy offspring's death unjust to call
  heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.
  why should heaven's law with foolish man comply
  exempted from the race ordain'd to die?
  this menace fix'd the warrior to his throne
  sullen he sat, and curb'd the rising groan.
  then juno call'd  jove's orders to obey
  the winged iris, and the god of day.
   go wait the thunderer's will  saturnia cried
  on yon tall summit of the fountful ide
  there in the father's awful presence stand,
  receive, and execute his dread command.
  she said, and sat  the god that gilds the day,
  and various iris, wing their airy way.
  swift as the wind, to ida's hills they came,
   fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game
  there sat the eternal  he whose nod controls
  the trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.
  veil'd in a mist of fragrance him they found,
  with clouds of gold and purple circled round.
  well-pleased the thunderer saw their earnest care,
  and prompt obedience to the queen of air
  then  while a smile serenes his awful brow
  commands the goddess of the showery bow
   iris! descend, and what we here ordain,
  report to yon mad tyrant of the main.
  bid him from fight to his own deeps repair,
  or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air.
  if he refuse, then let him timely weigh
  our elder birthright, and superior sway.
  how shall his rashness stand the dire alarms,
  if heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?
  strives he with me, by whom his power was given,
  and is there equal to the lord of heaven?
  the all-mighty spoke  the goddess wing'd her flight
  to sacred ilion from the idaean height.
  swift as the rattling hail, or fleecy snows,
  drive through the skies, when boreas fiercely blows
  so from the clouds descending iris falls,
  and to blue neptune thus the goddess calls
   attend the mandate of the sire above!
  in me behold the messenger of jove
  he bids thee from forbidden wars repair
  to thine own deeps, or to the fields of air.
  this if refused, he bids thee timely weigh
  his elder birthright, and superior sway.
  how shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms
  if heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?
  striv'st thou with him by whom all power is given?
  and art thou equal to the lord of heaven?
   what means the haughty sovereign of the skies?
   the king of ocean thus, incensed, replies
  rule as he will his portion'd realms on high
  no vassal god, nor of his train, am i.
  three brother deities from saturn came,
  and ancient rhea, earth's immortal dame
  assign'd by lot, our triple rule we know
  infernal pluto sways the shades below
  o'er the wide clouds, and o'er the starry plain,
  ethereal jove extends his high domain
  my court beneath the hoary waves i keep,
  and hush the roarings of the sacred deep
  olympus, and this earth, in common lie
  what claim has here the tyrant of the sky?
  far in the distant clouds let him control,
  and awe the younger brothers of the pole
  there to his children his commands be given,
  the trembling, servile, second race of heaven.
   and must i then  said she , o sire of floods!
  bear this fierce answer to the king of gods?
  correct it yet, and change thy rash intent
  a noble mind disdains not to repent.
  to elder brothers guardian fiends are given,
  to scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven.
   great is the profit  thus the god rejoin'd
  when ministers are blest with prudent mind
  warn'd by thy words, to powerful jove i yield,
  and quit, though angry, the contended field
  not but his threats with justice i disclaim,
  the same our honours, and our birth the same.
  if yet, forgetful of his promise given
  to hermes, pallas, and the queen of heaven,
  to favour ilion, that perfidious place,
  he breaks his faith with half the ethereal race
  give him to know, unless the grecian train
  lay yon proud structures level with the plain,
  howe'er the offence by other gods be pass'd,
  the wrath of neptune shall for ever last.
  thus speaking, furious from the field he strode,
  and plunged into the bosom of the flood.
  the lord of thunders, from his lofty height
  beheld, and thus bespoke the source of light
   behold! the god whose liquid arms are hurl'd
  around the globe, whose earthquakes rock the world,
  desists at length his rebel-war to wage,
  seeks his own seas, and trembles at our rage
  else had my wrath, heaven's thrones all shaking round,
  burn'd to the bottom of his seas profound
  and all the gods that round old saturn dwell
  had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell.
  well was the crime, and well the vengeance spared
  even power immense had found such battle hard.
  go thou, my son! the trembling greeks alarm,
  shake my broad aegis on thy active arm,
  be godlike hector thy peculiar care,
  swell his bold heart, and urge his strength to war
  let ilion conquer, till the achaian train
  fly to their ships and hellespont again
  then greece shall breathe from toils.  the godhead said
  his will divine the son of jove obey'd.
  not half so swift the sailing falcon flies,
  that drives a turtle through the liquid skies,
  as phoebus, shooting from the idaean brow,
  glides down the mountain to the plain below.
  there hector seated by the stream he sees,
  his sense returning with the coming breeze
  again his pulses beat, his spirits rise
  again his loved companions meet his eyes
  jove thinking of his pains, they pass'd away,
  to whom the god who gives the golden day
   why sits great hector from the field so far?
  what grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?
  the fainting hero, as the vision bright
  stood shining o'er him, half unseal'd his sight
   what blest immortal, with commanding breath,
  thus wakens hector from the sleep of death?
  has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword
  bathed greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,
  the mighty ajax with a deadly blow
  had almost sunk me to the shades below?
  even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts i spy,
  and hell's black horrors swim before my eye.
  to him apollo   be no more dismay'd
  see, and be strong! the thunderer sends thee aid.
  behold! thy phoebus shall his arms employ,
  phoebus, propitious still to thee and troy.
  inspire thy warriors then with manly force,
  and to the ships impel thy rapid horse
  even i will make thy fiery coursers way,
  and drive the grecians headlong to the sea.
  thus to bold hector spoke the son of jove,
  and breathed immortal ardour from above.
  as when the pamper'd steed, with reins unbound,
  breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground
  with ample strokes he rushes to the flood,
  to bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood
  his head, now freed, he tosses to the skies
  his mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies
  he snuffs the females in the well-known plain,
  and springs, exulting, to his fields again
  urged by the voice divine, thus hector flew,
  full of the god  and all his hosts pursue.
  as when the force of men and dogs combined
  invade the mountain goat, or branching hind
  far from the hunter's rage secure they lie
  close in the rock,  not fated yet to die
  when lo! a lion shoots across the way!
  they fly  at once the chasers and the prey.
  so greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,
  and mark'd their progress through the ranks in blood,
  soon as they see the furious chief appear,
  forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.
  thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,
  thoas, the bravest of the  tolian force
  skill'd to direct the javelin's distant flight,
  and bold to combat in the standing fight,
  not more in councils famed for solid sense,
  than winning words and heavenly eloquence.
   gods! what portent  he cried  these eyes invades?
  lo! hector rises from the stygian shades!
  we saw him, late, by thundering ajax kill'd
  what god restores him to the frighted field
  and not content that half of greece lie slain,
  pours new destruction on her sons again?
  he comes not, jove! without thy powerful will
  lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!
  yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand
  the greeks' main body to the fleet command
  but let the few whom brisker spirits warm,
  stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.
  thus point your arms  and when such foes appear,
  fierce as he is, let hector learn to fear.
  the warrior spoke  the listening greeks obey,
  thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.
  each ajax, teucer, merion gave command,
  the valiant leader of the cretan band
  and mars-like meges  these the chiefs excite,
  approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.
  behind, unnumber'd multitudes attend,
  to flank the navy, and the shores defend.
  full on the front the pressing trojans bear,
  and hector first came towering to the war.
  phoebus himself the rushing battle led
  a veil of clouds involved his radiant head
  high held before him, jove's enormous shield
  portentous shone, and shaded all the field
  vulcan to jove the immortal gift consign'd,
  to scatter hosts and terrify mankind,
  the greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise
  from different parts, and mingle in the skies.
  dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,
  and arrows leaping from the bow-string sung
  these drink the life of generous warriors slain
  those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.
  as long as phoebus bore unmoved the shield,
  sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field
  but when aloft he shakes it in the skies,
  shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,
  deep horror seizes every grecian breast,
  their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.
  so flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,
  no swain to guard them, and no day to guide,
  when two fell lions from the mountain come,
  and spread the carnage through the shady gloom.
  impending phoebus pours around them fear,
  and troy and hector thunder in the rear.
  heaps fall on heaps  the slaughter hector leads,
  first great arcesilas, then stichius bleeds
  one to the bold boeotians ever dear,
  and one menestheus' friend and famed compeer.
  medon and iasus,  neas sped
  this sprang from phelus, and the athenians led
  but hapless medon from oileus came
  him ajax honour'd with a brother's name,
  though born of lawless love  from home expell'd,
  a banish'd man, in phylace he dwell'd,
  press'd by the vengeance of an angry wife
  troy ends at last his labours and his life.
  mecystes next polydamas o'erthrew
  and thee, brave clonius, great agenor slew.
  by paris, deiochus inglorious dies,
  pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.
  polites' arm laid echius on the plain
  stretch'd on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.
  the greeks dismay'd, confused, disperse or fall,
  some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.
  while these fly trembling, others pant for breath,
  and o'er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.
  on rush'd bold hector, gloomy as the night
  forbids to plunder, animates the fight,
  points to the fleet   for, by the gods! who flies,
  who dares but linger, by this hand he dies
  no weeping sister his cold eye shall close,
  no friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.
  who stops to plunder at this signal hour,
  the birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour.
  furious he said  the smarting scourge resounds
  the coursers fly  the smoking chariot bounds
  the hosts rush on  loud clamours shake the shore
  the horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!
  apollo, planted at the trench's bound,
  push'd at the bank  down sank the enormous mound
  roll'd in the ditch the heapy ruin lay
  a sudden road! a long and ample way.
  o'er the dread fosse  a late impervious space
  now steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.
  the wondering crowds the downward level trod
  before them flamed the shield, and march'd the god.
  then with his hand he shook the mighty wall
  and lo! the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall
  easy as when ashore an infant stands,
  and draws imagined houses in the sands
  the sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,
  sweeps the slight works and fashion'd domes away
  thus vanish'd at thy touch, the towers and walls
  the toil of thousands in a moment falls.
  the grecians gaze around with wild despair,
  confused, and weary all the powers with prayer
  exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands
  and urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.
  experienced nestor chief obtests the skies,
  and weeps his country with a father's eyes.
   o jove! if ever, on his native shore,
  one greek enrich'd thy shrine with offer'd gore
  if e'er, in hope our country to behold,
  we paid the fattest firstlings of the fold
  if e'er thou sign'st our wishes with thy nod
  perform the promise of a gracious god!
  this day preserve our navies from the flame,
  and save the relics of the grecian name.
  thus prayed the sage  the eternal gave consent,
  and peals of thunder shook the firmament.
  presumptuous troy mistook the accepting sign,
  and catch'd new fury at the voice divine.
  as, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,
  the roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,
  above the sides of some tall ship ascend,
  its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend
  thus loudly roaring, and o'erpowering all,
  mount the thick trojans up the grecian wall
  legions on legions from each side arise
  thick sound the keels  the storm of arrows flies.
  fierce on the ships above, the cars below,
  these wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.
  while thus the thunder of the battle raged,
  and labouring armies round the works engaged,
  still in the tent patroclus sat to tend
  the good eurypylus, his wounded friend.
  he sprinkles healing balms, to anguish kind,
  and adds discourse, the medicine of the mind.
  but when he saw, ascending up the fleet,
  victorious troy  then, starting from his seat,
  with bitter groans his sorrows he express'd,
  he wrings his hands, he beats his manly breast.
   though yet thy state require redress  he cries
  depart i must  what horrors strike my eyes!
  charged with achilles' high command i go,
  a mournful witness of this scene of woe
  i haste to urge him by his country's care
  to rise in arms, and shine again in war.
  perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend
  the voice is powerful of a faithful friend.
  he spoke  and, speaking, swifter than the wind
  sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.
  the embodied greeks the fierce attack sustain,
  but strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain
  nor could the trojans, through that firm array,
  force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.
  as when a shipwright, with palladian art,
  smooths the rough wood, and levels every part
  with equal hand he guides his whole design,
  by the just rule, and the directing line
  the martial leaders, with like skill and care,
  preserved their line, and equal kept the war.
  brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,
  and every ship sustained an equal tide.
  at one proud bark, high-towering o'er the fleet,
  ajax the great, and godlike hector meet
  for one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,
  nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend
  one kept the shore, and one the vessel trod
  that fix'd as fate, this acted by a god.
  the son of clytius in his daring hand,
  the deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand
  but, pierced by telamon's huge lance, expires
  thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish'd fires.
  great hector view'd him with a sad survey,
  as stretch'd in dust before the stern he lay.
   oh! all of trojan, all of lycian race!
  stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space
  lo! where the son of royal clytius lies
  ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!
  this said, his eager javelin sought the foe
  but ajax shunn'd the meditated blow.
  not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown
  it stretch'd in dust unhappy lycophron
  an exile long, sustain'd at ajax' board,
  a faithful servant to a foreign lord
  in peace, and war, for ever at his side,
  near his loved master, as he lived, he died.
  from the high poop he tumbles on the sand,
  and lies a lifeless load along the land.
  with anguish ajax views the piercing sight,
  and thus inflames his brother to the fight
   teucer, behold! extended on the shore
  our friend, our loved companion! now no more!
  dear as a parent, with a parent's care
  to fight our wars he left his native air.
  this death deplored, to hector's rage we owe
  revenge, revenge it on the cruel foe.
  where are those darts on which the fates attend?
  and where the bow which phoebus taught to bend?
  impatient teucer, hastening to his aid,
  before the chief his ample bow display'd
  the well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung
  then hiss'd his arrow, and the bowstring sung.
  clytus, pisenor's son, renown'd in fame,
   to thee, polydamas! an honour'd name
  drove through the thickest of the embattled plains
  the startling steeds, and shook his eager reins.
  as all on glory ran his ardent mind,
  the pointed death arrests him from behind
  through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies
  in youth's first bloom reluctantly he dies.
  hurl'd from the lofty seat, at distance far,
  the headlong coursers spurn his empty car
  till sad polydamas the steeds restrain'd,
  and gave, astynous, to thy careful hand
  then, fired to vengeance, rush'd amidst the foe
  rage edged his sword, and strengthen'd every blow.
  once more bold teucer, in his country's cause,
  at hector's breast a chosen arrow draws
  and had the weapon found the destined way,
  thy fall, great trojan! had renown'd that day.
  but hector was not doom'd to perish then
  the all-wise disposer of the fates of men
   imperial jove  his present death withstands
  nor was such glory due to teucer's hands.
  at its full stretch as the tough string he drew,
  struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two
  down dropp'd the bow  the shaft with brazen head
  fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.
  the astonish'd archer to great ajax cries
   some god prevents our destined enterprise
  some god, propitious to the trojan foe,
  has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,
  and broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,
  strong to impel the flight of many a dart.
   since heaven commands it  ajax made reply
  dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by
  thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,
  and quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.
  in the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,
  thy brave example shall the rest inflame.
  fierce as they are, by long successes vain
  to force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,
  asks toil, and sweat, and blood  their utmost might
  shall find its match--no more  'tis ours to fight.
  then teucer laid his faithless bow aside
  the fourfold buckler o'er his shoulder tied
  on his brave head a crested helm he placed,
  with nodding horse-hair formidably graced
  a dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,
  the warrior wields  and his great brother joins.
  this hector saw, and thus express'd his joy
   ye troops of lycia, dardanus, and troy!
  be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,
  and spread your glory with the navy's flame.
  jove is with us  i saw his hand, but now,
  from the proud archer strike his vaunted bow
  indulgent jove! how plain thy favours shine,
  when happy nations bear the marks divine!
  how easy then, to see the sinking state
  of realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!
  such is the fate of greece, and such is ours
  behold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.
  death is the worst  a fate which all must try
  and for our country, 'tis a bliss to die.
  the gallant man, though slain in fight he be,
  yet leaves his nation safe, his children free
  entails a debt on all the grateful state
  his own brave friends shall glory in his fate
  his wife live honour'd, all his race succeed,
  and late posterity enjoy the deed!
  this roused the soul in every trojan breast
  the godlike ajax next his greeks address'd
   how long, ye warriors of the argive race,
   to generous argos what a dire disgrace!
  how long on these cursed confines will ye lie,
  yet undetermined, or to live or die?
  what hopes remain, what methods to retire,
  if once your vessels catch the trojan fire?
  make how the flames approach, how near they fall,
  how hector calls, and troy obeys his call!
  not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,
  it calls to death, and all the rage of fights.
  'tis now no time for wisdom or debates
  to your own hands are trusted all your fates
  and better far in one decisive strife,
  one day should end our labour or our life,
  than keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,
  still press'd, and press'd by such inglorious hands.
  the listening grecians feel their leader's flame,
  and every kindling bosom pants for fame.
  then mutual slaughters spread on either side
  by hector here the phocian schedius died
  there, pierced by ajax, sunk laodamas,
  chief of the foot, of old antenor's race.
  polydamas laid otus on the sand,
  the fierce commander of the epeian band.
  his lance bold meges at the victor threw
  the victor, stooping, from the death withdrew
   that valued life, o phoebus! was thy care
  but croesmus' bosom took the flying spear
  his corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore
  his radiant arms triumphant meges bore.
  dolops, the son of lampus, rushes on,
  sprung from the race of old laomedon,
  and famed for prowess in a well-fought field,
  he pierced the centre of his sounding shield
  but meges, phyleus' ample breastplate wore,
   well-known in fight on selle's winding shore
  for king euphetes gave the golden mail,
  compact, and firm with many a jointed scale
  which oft, in cities storm'd, and battles won,
  had saved the father, and now saves the son.
  full at the trojan's head he urged his lance,
  where the high plumes above the helmet dance,
  new ting'd with tyrian dye  in dust below,
  shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.
  meantime their fight the spartan king survey'd,
  and stood by meges' side a sudden aid.
  through dolops' shoulder urged his forceful dart,
  which held its passage through the panting heart,
  and issued at his breast. with thundering sound
  the warrior falls, extended on the ground.
  in rush the conquering greeks to spoil the slain
  but hector's voice excites his kindred train
  the hero most, from hicetaon sprung,
  fierce melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.
  he  ere to troy the grecians cross'd the main
  fed his large oxen on percote's plain
  but when oppress'd, his country claim'd his care,
  return'd to ilion, and excell'd in war
  for this, in priam's court, he held his place,
  beloved no less than priam's royal race.
  him hector singled, as his troops he led,
  and thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.
   lo, melanippus! lo, where dolops lies
  and is it thus our royal kinsman dies?
  o'ermatch'd he falls  to two at once a prey,
  and lo! they bear the bloody arms away!
  come on--a distant war no longer wage,
  but hand to hand thy country's foes engage
  till greece at once, and all her glory end
  or ilion from her towery height descend,
  heaved from the lowest stone  and bury all
  in one sad sepulchre, one common fall.
  hector  this said  rush'd forward on the foes
  with equal ardour melanippus glows
  then ajax thus-- o greeks! respect your fame,
  respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame
  let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,
  and catch from breast to breast the noble fire,
  on valour's side the odds of combat lie
  the brave live glorious, or lamented die
  the wretch that trembles in the field of fame,
  meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.
  his generous sense he not in vain imparts
  it sunk, and rooted in the grecian hearts
  they join, they throng, they thicken at his call,
  and flank the navy with a brazen wall
  shields touching shields, in order blaze above,
  and stop the trojans, though impell'd by jove.
  the fiery spartan first, with loud applause.
  warms the bold son of nestor in his cause.
   is there  he said  in arms a youth like you,
  so strong to fight, so active to pursue?
  why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?
  lift the bold lance, and make some trojan bleed.
  he said  and backward to the lines retired
  forth rush'd the youth with martial fury fired,
  beyond the foremost ranks  his lance he threw,
  and round the black battalions cast his view.
  the troops of troy recede with sudden fear,
  while the swift javelin hiss'd along in air.
  advancing melanippus met the dart
  with his bold breast, and felt it in his heart
  thundering he falls  his falling arms resound,
  and his broad buckler rings against the ground.
  the victor leaps upon his prostrate prize
  thus on a roe the well-breath'd beagle flies,
  and rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart
  the distant hunter sent into his heart.
  observing hector to the rescue flew
  bold as he was, antilochus withdrew.
  so when a savage, ranging o'er the plain,
  has torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd's swain,
  while conscious of the deed, he glares around,
  and hears the gathering multitude resound,
  timely he flies the yet-untasted food,
  and gains the friendly shelter of the wood
  so fears the youth  all troy with shouts pursue,
  while stones and darts in mingled tempest flew
  but enter'd in the grecian ranks, he turns
  his manly breast, and with new fury burns.
  now on the fleet the tides of trojans drove,
  fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of jove
  the sire of gods, confirming thetis' prayer,
  the grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair
  but lifts to glory troy's prevailing bands,
  swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.
  on ida's top he waits with longing eyes,
  to view the navy blazing to the skies
  then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,
  the trojans fly, and conquer'd ilion burn.
  these fates revolved in his almighty mind,
  he raises hector to the work design'd,
  bids him with more than mortal fury glow,
  and drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.
  so mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,
  shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.
  not with more rage a conflagration rolls,
  wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.
  he foams with wrath  beneath his gloomy brow
  like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow
  the radiant helmet on his temple burns,
  waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns
  for jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,
  and cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.
  unhappy glories! for his fate was near,
  due to stern pallas, and pelides' spear
  yet jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,
  and gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!
  now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes
  burn at each foe, and single every prize
  still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,
  he points his ardour, and exerts his might.
  the grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,
  on all sides batter'd, yet resists his power
  so some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,
  by winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain,
  unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,
  and sees the watery mountains break below.
  girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall
  like fire from jove, and bursts upon them all
  bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,
  and, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends
  white are the decks with foam  the winds aloud
  howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud
  pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears
  and instant death on every wave appears.
  so pale the greeks the eyes of hector meet,
  the chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.
  as when a lion, rushing from his den,
  amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,
   where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,
  at large expatiate o'er the ranker mead
  leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes
  the trembling herdsman far to distance flies
  some lordly bull  the rest dispersed and fled
  he singles out  arrests, and lays him dead.
  thus from the rage of jove-like hector flew
  all greece in heaps  but one he seized, and slew
  mycenian periphes, a mighty name,
  in wisdom great, in arms well known to fame
  the minister of stern eurystheus' ire
  against alcides, copreus was his sire
  the son redeem'd the honours of the race,
  a son as generous as the sire was base
  o'er all his country's youth conspicuous far
  in every virtue, or of peace or war
  but doom'd to hector's stronger force to yield!
  against the margin of his ample shield
  he struck his hasty foot  his heels up-sprung
  supine he fell  his brazen helmet rung.
  on the fallen chief the invading trojan press'd,
  and plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.
  his circling friends, who strove to guard too late
  the unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.
  chased from the foremost line, the grecian train
  now man the next, receding toward the main
  wedged in one body at the tents they stand,
  wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.
  now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight
  now fear itself confines them to the fight
  man courage breathes in man  but nestor most
   the sage preserver of the grecian host
  exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores
  and by their parents, by themselves implores.
   oh friends! be men  your generous breasts inflame
  with mutual honour, and with mutual shame!
  think of your hopes, your fortunes  all the care
  your wives, your infants, and your parents share
  think of each living father's reverend head
  think of each ancestor with glory dead
  absent, by me they speak, by me they sue,
  they ask their safety, and their fame, from you
  the gods their fates on this one action lay,
  and all are lost, if you desert the day.
  he spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires
  minerva seconds what the sage inspires.
  the mist of darkness jove around them threw
  she clear'd, restoring all the war to view
  a sudden ray shot beaming o'er the plain,
  and show'd the shores, the navy, and the main
  hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,
  the scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,
  first of the field great ajax strikes their eyes,
  his port majestic, and his ample size
  a ponderous mace with studs of iron crown'd,
  full twenty cubits long, he swings around
  nor fights, like others, fix'd to certain stands
  but looks a moving tower above the bands
  high on the decks with vast gigantic stride,
  the godlike hero stalks from side to side.
  so when a horseman from the watery mead
   skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed
  drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,
  to some great city through the public way
  safe in his art, as side by side they run,
  he shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one
  and now to this, and now to that he flies
  admiring numbers follow with their eyes.
  from ship to ship thus ajax swiftly flew,
  no less the wonder of the warring crew.
  as furious, hector thunder'd threats aloud,
  and rush'd enraged before the trojan crowd
  then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores
  lay rank'd contiguous on the bending shores
  so the strong eagle from his airy height,
  who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight,
  stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,
  and, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.
  jove leads him on with his almighty hand,
  and breathes fierce spirits in his following band.
  the warring nations meet, the battle roars,
  thick beats the combat on the sounding prores.
  thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,
  no force could tame them, and no toil could tire
  as if new vigour from new fights they won,
  and the long battle was but then begun.
  greece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war,
  secure of death, confiding in despair
  troy in proud hopes already view'd the main
  bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain
  like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,
  and each contends, as his were all the war.
   twas thou, bold hector! whose resistless hand
  first seized a ship on that contested strand
  the same which dead protesilaus bore,
  the first that touch'd the unhappy trojan shore
  for this in arms the warring nations stood,
  and bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.
  no room to poise the lance or bend the bow
  but hand to hand, and man to man, they grow
  wounded, they wound  and seek each other's hearts
  with falchions, axes, swords, and shorten'd darts.
  the falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,
  swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground
  with streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed,
  and slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
  still raging, hector with his ample hand
  grasps the high stern, and gives this loud command
   haste, bring the flames! that toil of ten long years
  is finished  and the day desired appears!
  this happy day with acclamations greet,
  bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet.
  the coward-counsels of a timorous throng
  of reverend dotards check'd our glory long
  too long jove lull'd us with lethargic charms,
  but now in peals of thunder calls to arms
  in this great day he crowns our full desires,
  wakes all our force, and seconds all our fires.
  he spoke--the warriors at his fierce command
  pour a new deluge on the grecian band.
  even ajax paused,  so thick the javelins fly,
  stepp'd back, and doubted or to live or die.
  yet, where the oars are placed, he stands to wait
  what chief approaching dares attempt his fate
  even to the last his naval charge defends,
  now shakes his spear, now lifts, and now protends
  even yet, the greeks with piercing shouts inspires,
  amidst attacks, and deaths, and darts, and fires.
   o friends! o heroes! names for ever dear,
  once sons of mars, and thunderbolts of war!
  ah! yet be mindful of your old renown,
  your great forefathers' virtues and your own.
  what aids expect you in this utmost strait?
  what bulwarks rising between you and fate?
  no aids, no bulwarks your retreat attend,
  no friends to help, no city to defend.
  this spot is all you have, to lose or keep
  there stand the trojans, and here rolls the deep.
  'tis hostile ground you tread  your native lands
  far, far from hence  your fates are in your hands.
  raging he spoke  nor further wastes his breath,
  but turns his javelin to the work of death.
  whate'er bold trojan arm'd his daring hands,
  against the sable ships, with flaming brands,
  so well the chief his naval weapon sped,
  the luckless warrior at his stern lay dead
  full twelve, the boldest, in a moment fell,
  sent by great ajax to the shades of hell.
  so warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore,
  while the black vessels smoked with human gore.
  meantime patroclus to achilles flies
  the streaming tears fall copious from his eyes
  not faster, trickling to the plains below,
  from the tall rock the sable waters flow.
  divine pelides, with compassion moved.
  thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved
   patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,
  that flows so fast in these unmanly tears?
  no girl, no infant whom the mother keeps
  from her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps
  not more the mother's soul, that infant warms,
  clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,
  than thou hast mine! oh tell me, to what end
  thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?
   griev'st thou for me, or for, my martial band?
  or come sad tidings from our native land?
  our fathers live  our first, most tender care ,
  thy good menoetius breathes the vital air,
  and hoary peleus yet extends his days
  pleased in their age to hear their children's praise.
  or may some meaner cause thy pity claim?
  perhaps yon relics of the grecian name,
  doom'd in their ships to sink by fire and sword,
  and pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?
  whate'er the cause, reveal thy secret care,
  and speak those sorrows which a friend would share.
  a sigh that instant from his bosom broke,
  another follow'd, and patroclus spoke
   let greece at length with pity touch thy breast,
  thyself a greek  and, once, of greeks the best!
  lo! every chief that might her fate prevent,
  lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent
  eurypylus, tydides, atreus' son,
  and wise ulysses, at the navy groan,
  more for their country's wounds than for their own.
  their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,
  thy breast alone no lenitives appease.
  may never rage like thine my soul enslave,
  o great in vain! unprofitably brave!
  thy country slighted in her last distress,
  what friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?
  no--men unborn, and ages yet behind,
  shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.
   o man unpitying! if of man thy race
  but sure thou spring'st not from a soft embrace,
  nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,
  nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth
  some rugged rock's hard entrails gave thee form,
  and raging seas produced thee in a storm,
  a soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,
  so rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.
   if some dire oracle thy breast alarm,
  if aught from jove, or thetis, stop thy arm,
  some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine,
  if i but lead the myrmidonian line
  clad in thy dreadful arms if i appear,
  proud troy shall tremble, and desert the war
  without thy person greece shall win the day,
  and thy mere image chase her foes away.
  press'd by fresh forces, her o'erlabour'd train
  shall quit the ships, and greece respire again.
  thus, blind to fate! with supplicating breath,
  thou begg'st his arms, and in his arms thy death.
  unfortunately good! a boding sigh
  thy friend return'd  and with it, this reply
   patroclus! thy achilles knows no fears
  nor words from jove nor oracles he hears
  nor aught a mother's caution can suggest
  the tyrant's pride lies rooted in my breast.
  my wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage,
  those, my sole oracles, inspire my rage
  i made him tyrant  gave him power to wrong
  even my  i felt it  and shall feel it long.
  the maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away,
  due to the toils of many a well-fought day
  due to my conquest of her father's reign
  due to the votes of all the grecian train.
  from me he forced her  me, the bold and brave,
  disgraced, dishonour'd, like the meanest slave.
  but bear we this--the wrongs i grieve are past
  'tis time our fury should relent at last
  i fix'd its date  the day i wish'd appears
  how hector to my ships his battle bears,
  the flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears.
  go then, patroclus! court fair honour's charms
  in troy's famed fields, and in achilles' arms
  lead forth my martial myrmidons to fight,
  go save the fleets, and conquer in my right.
  see the thin relics of their baffled band
  at the last edge of yon deserted land!
  behold all ilion on their ships descends
  how the cloud blackens, how the storm impends!
  it was not thus, when, at my sight amazed,
  troy saw and trembled, as this helmet blazed
  had not the injurious king our friendship lost,
  yon ample trench had buried half her host.
  no camps, no bulwarks now the trojans fear,
  those are not dreadful, no achilles there
  no longer flames the lance of tydeus' son
  no more your general calls his heroes on
  hector, alone, i hear  his dreadful breath
  commands your slaughter, or proclaims your death.
  yet now, patroclus, issue to the plain
  now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,
  and give the greeks to visit greece again.
  but heed my words, and mark a friend's command,
  who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand,
  and from thy deeds expects the achaian host
  shall render back the beauteous maid he lost
  rage uncontroll'd through all the hostile crew,
  but touch not hector, hector is my due.
  though jove in thunder should command the war,
  be just, consult my glory, and forbear.
  the fleet once saved, desist from further chase,
  nor lead to ilion's walls the grecian race
  some adverse god thy rashness may destroy
  some god, like phoebus, ever kind to troy.
  let greece, redeem'd from this destructive strait,
  do her own work  and leave the rest to fate.
  o! would to all the immortal powers above,
  apollo, pallas, and almighty jove!
  that not one trojan might be left alive,
  and not a greek of all the race survive
  might only we the vast destruction shun,
  and only we destroy the accursed town!
  such conference held the chiefs  while on the strand
  great jove with conquest crown'd the trojan band.
  ajax no more the sounding storm sustain'd,
  so thick the darts an iron tempest rain'd
  on his tired arm the weighty buckler hung
  his hollow helm with falling javelins rung
  his breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes
  and painful sweat from all his members flows.
  spent and o'erpower'd, he barely breathes at most
  yet scarce an army stirs him from his post
  dangers on dangers all around him glow,
  and toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.
  say, muses, throned above the starry frame,
  how first the navy blazed with trojan flame?
  stern hector waved his sword, and standing near,
  where furious ajax plied his ashen spear,
  full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,
  that the broad falchion lopp'd its brazen head
  his pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain
  the brazen head falls sounding on the plain.
  great ajax saw, and own'd the hand divine
  confessing jove, and trembling at the sign,
  warn'd he retreats. then swift from all sides pour
  the hissing brands  thick streams the fiery shower
  o'er the high stern the curling volumes rise,
  and sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.
  divine achilles view'd the rising flames,
  and smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims
   arm, arm, patroclus! lo, the blaze aspires!
  the glowing ocean reddens with the fires.
  arm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame
  arm, ere the grecians be no more a name
  i haste to bring the troops. --the hero said
  the friend with ardour and with joy obey'd.
  he cased his limbs in brass  and first around
  his manly legs, with silver buckles bound
  the clasping greaves  then to his breast applies
  the flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes
  emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone
  in the rich belt, as in a starry zone
  achilles' shield his ample shoulders spread,
  achilles' helmet nodded o'er his head
  adorn'd in all his terrible array,
  he flash'd around intolerable day.
  alone untouch'd, pelides' javelin stands,
  not to be poised but by pelides' hands
  from pelion's shady brow the plant entire
  old chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire
  whose son's great arm alone the weapon wields,
  the death of heroes, and the dread of fields.
  the brave automedon  an honour'd name,
  the second to his lord in love and fame,
  in peace his friend, and partner of the war
  the winged coursers harness'd to the car
  xanthus and balius, of immortal breed,
  sprung from the wind, and like the wind in speed.
  whom the wing'd harpy, swift podarge, bore,
  by zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore
  swift pedasus was added to their side,
   once great aetion's, now achilles' pride
  who, like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace,
  a mortal courser match'd the immortal race.
  achilles speeds from tent to tent, and warms
  his hardy myrmidons to blood and arms.
  all breathing death, around the chief they stand,
  a grim, terrific, formidable band
  grim as voracious wolves, that seek the springs
  when scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings
  when some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood,
  has drench'd their wide insatiate throats with blood,
  to the black fount they rush, a hideous throng,
  with paunch distended, and with lolling tongue,
  fire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore,
  and gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.
  like furious, rush'd the myrmidonian crew,
  such their dread strength, and such their deathful view.
  high in the midst the great achilles stands,
  directs their order, and the war commands.
  he, loved of jove, had launch'd for ilion's shores
  full fifty vessels, mann'd with fifty oars
  five chosen leaders the fierce bands obey,
  himself supreme in valour, as in sway.
  first march'd menestheus, of celestial birth,
  derived from thee, whose waters wash the earth,
  divine sperchius! jove-descended flood!
  a mortal mother mixing with a god.
  such was menestheus, but miscall'd by fame
  the son of borus, that espoused the dame.
  eudorus next  whom polymele the gay,
  famed in the graceful dance, produced to-day.
  her, sly cellenius loved  on her would gaze,
  as with swift step she form'd the running maze
  to her high chamber from diana's quire,
  the god pursued her, urged, and crown'd his fire.
  the son confess'd his father's heavenly race,
  and heir'd his mother's swiftness in the chase.
  strong echecleus, bless'd in all those charms
  that pleased a god, succeeded to her arms
  not conscious of those loves, long hid from fame,
  with gifts of price he sought and won the dame
  her secret offspring to her sire she bare
  her sire caress'd him with a parent's care.
  pisander follow'd  matchless in his art
  to wing the spear, or aim the distant dart
  no hand so sure of all the emathian line,
  or if a surer, great patroclus! thine.
  the fourth by phoenix' grave command was graced,
  laerces' valiant offspring led the last.
  soon as achilles with superior care
  had call'd the chiefs, and order'd all the war,
  this stern remembrance to his troops he gave
   ye far-famed myrmidons, ye fierce and brave!
  think with what threats you dared the trojan throng,
  think what reproach these ears endured so long
  'stern son of peleus,  thus ye used to say,
  while restless, raging, in your ships you lay
  oh nursed with gall, unknowing how to yield
  whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field
  if that dire fury must for ever burn,
  what make we here? return, ye chiefs, return!'
  such were your words--now, warriors! grieve no more,
  lo there the trojans  bathe your swords in gore!
  this day shall give you all your soul demands,
  glut all your hearts, and weary all your hands!
  thus while he roused the fire in every breast,
  close and more close the listening cohorts press'd
  ranks wedged in ranks  of arms a steely ring
  still grows, and spreads, and thickens round the king.
  as when a circling wall the builder forms,
  of strength defensive against wind and storms,
  compacted stones the thickening work compose,
  and round him wide the rising structure grows
  so helm to helm, and crest to crest they throng,
  shield urged on shield, and man drove man along
  thick, undistinguish'd plumes, together join'd,
  float in one sea, and wave before the wind.
  far o'er the rest in glittering pomp appear,
  there bold automedon, patroclus here
  brothers in arms, with equal fury fired
  two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired.
  but mindful of the gods, achilles went
  to the rich coffer in his shady tent
  there lay on heaps his various garments roll'd,
  and costly furs, and carpets stiff with gold,
   the presents of the silver-footed dame
  from thence he took a bowl, of antique frame,
  which never man had stained with ruddy wine,
  nor raised in offerings to the power divine,
  but peleus' son  and peleus' son to none
  had raised in offerings, but to jove alone.
  this tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame,
  he purged  and wash'd it in the running stream.
  then cleansed his hands  and fixing for a space
  his eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place
  of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour'd
  forth in the midst  and thus the god implored
   o thou supreme! high-throned all height above!
  o great pelasgic, dodonaean jove!
  who 'midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill,
  presid'st on bleak dodona's vocal hill
   whose groves the selli, race austere! surround,
  their feet unwash'd, their slumbers on the ground
  who hear, from rustling oaks, thy dark decrees
  and catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze
  hear, as of old! thou gav'st, at thetis' prayer,
  glory to me, and to the greeks despair.
  lo, to the dangers of the fighting field
  the best, the dearest of my friends, i yield,
  though still determined, to my ships confined
  patroclus gone, i stay but half behind.
  oh! be his guard thy providential care,
  confirm his heart, and string his arm to war
  press'd by his single force let hector see
  his fame in arms not owing all to me.
  but when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,
  let him with conquest and renown retire
  preserve his arms, preserve his social train,
  and safe return him to these eyes again!
  great jove consents to half the chief's request,
  but heaven's eternal doom denies the rest
  to free the fleet was granted to his prayer
  his safe return, the winds dispersed in air.
  back to his tent the stern achilles flies,
  and waits the combat with impatient eyes.
  meanwhile the troops beneath patroclus' care,
  invade the trojans, and commence the war.
  as wasps, provoked by children in their play,
  pour from their mansions by the broad highway,
  in swarms the guiltless traveller engage,
  whet all their stings, and call forth all their rage
  all rise in arms, and, with a general cry,
  assert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny.
  thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,
  so loud their clamours, and so keen their arms
  their rising rage patroclus' breath inspires,
  who thus inflames them with heroic fires
   o warriors, partners of achilles' praise!
  be mindful of your deeds in ancient days
  your godlike master let your acts proclaim,
  and add new glories to his mighty name.
  think your achilles sees you fight  be brave,
  and humble the proud monarch whom you save.
  joyful they heard, and kindling as he spoke,
  flew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke.
  from shore to shore the doubling shouts resound,
  the hollow ships return a deeper sound.
  the war stood still, and all around them gazed,
  when great achilles' shining armour blazed
  troy saw, and thought the dread achilles nigh,
  at once they see, they tremble, and they fly.
  then first thy spear, divine patroclus! flew,
  where the war raged, and where the tumult grew.
  close to the stern of that famed ship which bore
  unbless'd protesilaus to ilion's shore,
  the great paeonian, bold pyrechmes stood
   who led his bands from axius' winding flood
  his shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound
  the groaning warrior pants upon the ground.
  his troops, that see their country's glory slain,
  fly diverse, scatter'd o'er the distant plain.
  patroclus' arm forbids the spreading fires,
  and from the half-burn'd ship proud troy retires
  clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies
  in heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies
  triumphant greece her rescued decks ascends,
  and loud acclaim the starry region rends.
  so when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head,
  o'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread
  sudden the thunderer, with a flashing ray,
  bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day
  the hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise,
  and streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes
  the smiling scene wide opens to the sight,
  and all the unmeasured ether flames with light.
  but troy repulsed, and scatter'd o'er the plains,
  forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.
  now every greek some hostile hero slew,
  but still the foremost, bold patroclus flew
  as areilycus had turn'd him round,
  sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound
  the brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,
  the thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone
  headlong he fell. next, thoas was thy chance
  thy breast, unarm'd, received the spartan lance.
  phylides' dart  as amphidus drew nigh
  his blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,
  tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away
  in darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.
  in equal arms two sons of nestor stand,
  and two bold brothers of the lycian band
  by great antilochus, atymnius dies,
  pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,
  kind maris, bleeding in his brother's wound,
  defends the breathless carcase on the ground
  furious he flies, his murderer to engage
  but godlike thrasimed prevents his rage,
  between his arm and shoulder aims a blow
  his arm falls spouting on the dust below
  he sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er
  and vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.
  slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,
  sarpedon's friends, amisodarus' seed
  amisodarus, who, by furies led,
  the bane of men, abhorr'd chimaera bred
  skill'd in the dart in vain, his sons expire,
  and pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.
  stopp'd in the tumult cleobulus lies,
  beneath oileus' arm, a living prize
  a living prize not long the trojan stood
  the thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood
  plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies
  black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.
  amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,
  lycon the brave, and fierce peneleus came
  in vain their javelins at each other flew,
  now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.
  on the plumed crest of his boeotian foe
  the daring lycon aim'd a noble blow
  the sword broke short  but his, peneleus sped
  full on the juncture of the neck and head
  the head, divided by a stroke so just,
  hung by the skin  the body sunk to dust.
  o'ertaken neamas by merion bleeds,
  pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds
  back from the car he tumbles to the ground
  his swimming eyes eternal shades surround.
  next erymas was doom'd his fate to feel,
  his open'd mouth received the cretan steel
  beneath the brain the point a passage tore,
  crash'd the thin bones, and drown'd the teeth in gore
  his mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood
  he sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.
  as when the flocks neglected by the swain,
  or kids, or lambs, lie scatter'd o'er the plain,
  a troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,
  and rend the trembling, unresisting prey
  thus on the foe the greeks impetuous came
  troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.
  but still at hector godlike ajax aim'd,
  still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.
  the trojan chief, experienced in the field,
  o'er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,
  observed the storm of darts the grecians pour,
  and on his buckler caught the ringing shower
  he sees for greece the scale of conquest rise,
  yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.
  as when the hand of jove a tempest forms,
  and rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,
  dark o'er the fields the ascending vapour flies,
  and shades the sun, and blots the golden skies
  so from the ships, along the dusky plain,
  dire flight and terror drove the trojan train.
  even hector fled  through heads of disarray
  the fiery coursers forced their lord away
  while far behind his trojans fall confused
  wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised
  chariots on chariots roll  the clashing spokes
  shock  while the madding steeds break short their yokes.
  in vain they labour up the steepy mound
  their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.
  fierce on the rear, with shouts patroclus flies
  tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies
  thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight
  clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch'd from sight.
  the affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,
  scour o'er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.
  loud o'er the rout was heard the victor's cry,
  where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,
  where horse and arms, and chariots he o'erthrown,
  and bleeding heroes under axles groan.
  no stop, no check, the steeds of peleus knew
  from bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.
  high-bounding o'er the fosse, the whirling car
  smokes through the ranks, o'ertakes the flying war,
  and thunders after hector  hector flies,
  patroclus shakes his lance  but fate denies.
  not with less noise, with less impetuous force,
  the tide of trojans urge their desperate course,
  than when in autumn jove his fury pours,
  and earth is loaden with incessant showers
   when guilty mortals break the eternal laws,
  or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause
  from their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,
  and opens all the flood-gates of the skies
  the impetuous torrents from their hills obey,
  whole fields are drown'd, and mountains swept away
  loud roars the deluge till it meets the main
  and trembling man sees all his labours vain!
  and now the chief  the foremost troops repell'd
  back to the ships his destined progress held,
  bore down half troy in his resistless way,
  and forced the routed ranks to stand the day.
  between the space where silver simois flows,
  where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,
  all grim in dust and blood patroclus stands,
  and turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.
  first pronous died beneath his fiery dart,
  which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.
  thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,
  and fell the victim of his coward fear
  shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,
  nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly
  patroclus mark'd him as he shunn'd the war,
  and with unmanly tremblings shook the car,
  and dropp'd the flowing reins. him 'twixt the jaws,
  the javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.
  as on a rock that overhangs the main,
  an angler, studious of the line and cane,
  some mighty fish draws panting to the shore
  not with less ease the barbed javelin bore
  the gaping dastard  as the spear was shook,
  he fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.
  next on eryalus he flies  a stone,
  large as a rock, was by his fury thrown
  full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,
  and burst the helm, and cleft the head in two
  prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,
  and death involved him with the shades of hell.
  then low in dust epaltes, echius, lie
  ipheas, evippus, polymelus, die
  amphoterus and erymas succeed
  and last tlepolemus and pyres bleed.
  where'er he moves, the growing slaughters spread
  in heaps on heaps a monument of dead.
  when now sarpedon his brave friends beheld
  grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,
  with this reproach his flying host he warms
   oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!
  forsake, inglorious, the contended plain
  this hand unaided shall the war sustain
  the task be mine this hero's strength to try,
  who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.
  he spake  and, speaking, leaps from off the car
  patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.
  as when two vultures on the mountain's height
  stoop with resounding pinions to the fight
  they cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry
  the desert echoes, and the rocks reply
  the warriors thus opposed in arms, engage
  with equal clamours, and with equal rage.
  jove view'd the combat  whose event foreseen,
  he thus bespoke his sister and his queen
   the hour draws on  the destinies ordain,
  my godlike son shall press the phrygian plain
  already on the verge of death he stands,
  his life is owed to fierce patroclus' hands,
  what passions in a parent's breast debate!
  say, shall i snatch him from impending fate,
  and send him safe to lycia, distant far
  from all the dangers and the toils of war
  or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,
  and fatten, with celestial blood, the field?
  then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes
   what words are these, o sovereign of the skies!
  short is the date prescribed to mortal man
  shall jove for one extend the narrow span,
  whose bounds were fix'd before his race began?
  how many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death,
  before proud ilion must resign their breath!
  were thine exempt, debate would rise above,
  and murmuring powers condemn their partial jove.
  give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight
  and when the ascending soul has wing'd her flight,
  let sleep and death convey, by thy command,
  the breathless body to his native land.
  his friends and people, to his future praise,
  a marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,
  and lasting honours to his ashes give
  his fame  'tis all the dead can have  shall live.
  she said  the cloud-compeller, overcome,
  assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.
  then touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd
  a shower of blood o'er all the fatal field
  the god, his eyes averting from the plain,
  laments his son, predestined to be slain,
  far from the lycian shores, his happy native reign.
  now met in arms, the combatants appear
  each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear
  from strong patroclus' hand the javelin fled,
  and pass'd the groin of valiant thrasymed
  the nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,
  he falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.
  two sounding darts the lycian leader threw
  the first aloof with erring fury flew,
  the next transpierced achilles' mortal steed,
  the generous pedasus of theban breed
  fix'd in the shoulder's joint, he reel'd around,
  roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.
  his sudden fall the entangled harness broke
  each axle crackled, and the chariot shook
  when bold automedon, to disengage
  the starting coursers, and restrain their rage,
  divides the traces with his sword, and freed
  the encumbered chariot from the dying steed
  the rest move on, obedient to the rein
  the car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.
  the towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance
  and first sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,
  which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,
  and spent in empty air its dying force.
  not so patroclus' never-erring dart
  aim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,
  where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.
  then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,
  or pine  fit mast for some great admiral
  nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound
  it sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,
  thus fell the king  and laid on earth supine,
  before his chariot stretch'd his form divine
  he grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,
  and, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.
  so lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,
  while the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws
  the trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood
  deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.
  then to the leader of the lycian band
  the dying chief address'd his last command
   glaucus, be bold  thy task be first to dare
  the glorious dangers of destructive war,
  to lead my troops, to combat at their head,
  incite the living, and supply the dead.
  tell them, i charged them with my latest breath
  not unrevenged to bear sarpedon's death.
  what grief, what shame, must glaucus undergo,
  if these spoil'd arms adorn a grecian foe!
  then as a friend, and as a warrior fight
  defend my body, conquer in my right
  that, taught by great examples, all may try
  like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.
  he ceased  the fates suppress'd his labouring breath,
  and his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.
  the insulting victor with disdain bestrode
  the prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod
  then drew the weapon from his panting heart,
  the reeking fibres clinging to the dart
  from the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,
  and the soul issued in the purple flood.
  his flying steeds the myrmidons detain,
  unguided now, their mighty master slain.
  all-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,
  unhappy glaucus heard the dying chief
  his painful arm, yet useless with the smart
  inflicted late by teucer's deadly dart,
  supported on his better hand he stay'd
  to phoebus then  'twas all he could  he pray'd
   all-seeing monarch! whether lycia's coast,
  or sacred ilion, thy bright presence boast,
  powerful alike to ease the wretch's smart
  o hear me! god of every healing art!
  lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,
  that thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,
  i stand unable to sustain the spear,
  and sigh, at distance from the glorious war.
  low in the dust is great sarpedon laid,
  nor jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid
  but thou, o god of health! thy succour lend,
  to guard the relics of my slaughter'd friend
  for thou, though distant, canst restore my might,
  to head my lycians, and support the fight.
  apollo heard  and, suppliant as he stood,
  his heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood
  he drew the dolours from the wounded part,
  and breathed a spirit in his rising heart.
  renew'd by art divine, the hero stands,
  and owns the assistance of immortal hands.
  first to the fight his native troops he warms,
  then loudly calls on troy's vindictive arms
  with ample strides he stalks from place to place
  now fires agenor, now polydamas
   neas next, and hector he accosts
  inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.
   what thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?
  oh too forgetful of the friends of troy!
  those generous friends, who, from their country far,
  breathe their brave souls out in another's war.
  see! where in dust the great sarpedon lies,
  in action valiant, and in council wise,
  who guarded right, and kept his people free
  to all his lycians lost, and lost to thee!
  stretch'd by patroclus' arm on yonder plains,
  o save from hostile rage his loved remains!
  ah let not greece his conquer'd trophies boast,
  nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!
  he spoke  each leader in his grief partook
  troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.
  transfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown
  at once his country's pillar, and their own
  a chief, who led to troy's beleaguer'd wall
  a host of heroes, and outshined them all.
  fired, they rush on  first hector seeks the foes,
  and with superior vengeance greatly glows.
  but o'er the dead the fierce patroclus stands,
  and rousing ajax, roused the listening bands
   heroes, be men  be what you were before
  or weigh the great occasion, and be more.
  the chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,
  lies pale in death, extended on the field.
  to guard his body troy in numbers flies
  tis half the glory to maintain our prize.
  haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,
  and send the living lycians to the dead.
  the heroes kindle at his fierce command
  the martial squadrons close on either hand
  here troy and lycia charge with loud alarms,
  thessalia there, and greece, oppose their arms.
  with horrid shouts they circle round the slain
  the clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.
  great jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,
  o'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,
  and round his son confounds the warring hosts,
  his fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.
  now greece gives way, and great epigeus falls
  agacleus' son, from budium's lofty walls
  who chased for murder thence a suppliant came
  to peleus, and the silver-footed dame
  now sent to troy, achilles' arms to aid,
  he pays due vengeance to his kinsman's shade.
  soon as his luckless hand had touch'd the dead,
  a rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head
  hurl'd by hectorean force it cleft in twain
  his shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.
  fierce to the van of fight patroclus came,
  and, like an eagle darting at his game,
  sprung on the trojan and the lycian band.
  what grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,
  o generous greek! when with full vigour thrown,
  at sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,
  which sunk him to the dead  when troy, too near
  that arm, drew back  and hector learn'd to fear.
  far as an able hand a lance can throw,
  or at the lists, or at the fighting foe
  so far the trojans from their lines retired
  till glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.
  then bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,
  the only hope of chalcon's trembling age
  wide o'er the land was stretch'd his large domain,
  with stately seats, and riches blest in vain
  him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue
  the flying lycians, glaucus met and slew
  pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,
  he fell, and falling made the fields resound.
  the achaians sorrow for their heroes slain
  with conquering shouts the trojans shake the plain,
  and crowd to spoil the dead  the greeks oppose
  an iron circle round the carcase grows.
  then brave laogonus resign'd his breath,
  despatch'd by merion to the shades of death
  on ida's holy hill he made abode,
  the priest of jove, and honour'd like his god.
  between the jaw and ear the javelin went
  the soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.
  his spear aeneas at the victor threw,
  who stooping forward from the death withdrew
  the lance hiss'd harmless o'er his covering shield,
  and trembling struck, and rooted in the field
  there yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,
  sent by the great aeneas' arm in vain.
   swift as thou art  the raging hero cries
  and skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize,
  my spear, the destined passage had it found,
  had fix'd thy active vigour to the ground.
   o valiant leader of the dardan host!
   insulted merion thus retorts the boast
  strong as you are, 'tis mortal force you trust,
  an arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.
  and if to this my lance thy fate be given,
  vain are thy vaunts  success is still from heaven
  this, instant, sends thee down to pluto's coast
  mine is the glory, his thy parting ghost.
   o friend  menoetius' son this answer gave
  with words to combat, ill befits the brave
  not empty boasts the sons of troy repel,
  your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.
  to speak, beseems the council  but to dare
  in glorious action, is the task of war.
  this said, patroclus to the battle flies
  great merion follows, and new shouts arise
  shields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close
  and thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.
  as through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,
  the labours of the woodman's axe resound
  blows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,
  while crackling forests fall on every side
  thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,
  so fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.
  now great sarpedon on the sandy shore,
  his heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,
  and stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,
  lies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead.
  his long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,
  on every side the busy combat grows
  thick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode
   the pails high foaming with a milky flood
  the buzzing flies, a persevering train,
  incessant swarm, and chased return again.
  jove view'd the combat with a stern survey,
  and eyes that flash'd intolerable day.
  fix'd on the field his sight, his breast debates
  the vengeance due, and meditates the fates
  whether to urge their prompt effect, and call
  the force of hector to patroclus' fall,
  this instant see his short-lived trophies won,
  and stretch him breathless on his slaughter'd son
  or yet, with many a soul's untimely flight,
  augment the fame and horror of the fight.
  to crown achilles' valiant friend with praise
  at length he dooms  and, that his last of days
  shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe
  nor unattended see the shades below.
  then hector's mind he fills with dire dismay
  he mounts his car, and calls his hosts away
  sunk with troy's heavy fates, he sees decline
  the scales of jove, and pants with awe divine.
  then, nor before, the hardy lycians fled,
  and left their monarch with the common dead
  around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall
  of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.
   so jove decreed!  at length the greeks obtain
  the prize contested, and despoil the slain.
  the radiant arms are by patroclus borne
  patroclus' ships the glorious spoils adorn.
  then thus to phoebus, in the realms above,
  spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling jove
   descend, my phoebus! on the phrygian plain,
  and from the fight convey sarpedon slain
  then bathe his body in the crystal flood,
  with dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with blood
  o'er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,
  and with celestial robes adorn the dead.
  those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath
  to the soft arms of silent sleep and death.
  they to his friends the immortal charge shall bear
  his friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear
  what honour mortals after death receive,
  those unavailing honours we may give!
  apollo bows, and from mount ida's height,
  swift to the field precipitates his flight
  thence from the war the breathless hero bore,
  veil'd in a cloud, to silver simois' shore
  there bathed his honourable wounds, and dress'd
  his manly members in the immortal vest
  and with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews
  restores his freshness, and his form renews.
  then sleep and death, two twins of winged race,
  of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,
  received sarpedon, at the god's command,
  and in a moment reach'd the lycian land
  the corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,
  where endless honours wait the sacred shade.
  meanwhile patroclus pours along the plains,
  with foaming coursers, and with loosen'd reins.
  fierce on the trojan and the lycian crew,
  ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew
  against what fate and powerful jove ordain,
  vain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain.
  for he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll'd
  dismay the mighty, and confound the bold
  the god who gives, resumes, and orders all,
  he urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.
  who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,
  who last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain
  when heaven itself thy fatal fury led,
  and call'd to fill the number of the dead?
  adrestus first  autonous then succeeds
  echeclus follows  next young megas bleeds,
  epistor, melanippus, bite the ground
  the slaughter, elasus and mulius crown'd
  then sunk pylartes to eternal night
  the rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.
  now troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power,
  but flaming phoebus kept the sacred tower
  thrice at the battlements patroclus strook
  his blazing aegis thrice apollo shook
  he tried the fourth  when, bursting from the cloud,
  a more than mortal voice was heard aloud.
   patroclus! cease  this heaven-defended wall
  defies thy lance  not fated yet to fall
  thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,
  troy shall not stoop even to achilles' hand.
  so spoke the god who darts celestial fires
  the greek obeys him, and with awe retires.
  while hector, checking at the scaean gates
  his panting coursers, in his breast debates,
  or in the field his forces to employ,
  or draw the troops within the walls of troy.
  thus while he thought, beside him phoebus stood,
  in asius' shape, who reigned by sangar's flood
   thy brother, hecuba! from dymas sprung,
  a valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young
  thus he accosts him.  what a shameful sight!
  god! is it hector that forbears the fight?
  were thine my vigour this successful spear
  should soon convince thee of so false a fear.
  turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,
  and in patroclus' blood efface thy shame.
  perhaps apollo shall thy arms succeed,
  and heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.
  so spoke the inspiring god  then took his flight,
  and plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.
  he bids cebrion drive the rapid car
  the lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.
  the god the grecians' sinking souls depress'd,
  and pour'd swift spirits through each trojan breast.
  patroclus lights, impatient for the fight
  a spear his left, a stone employs his right
  with all his nerves he drives it at the foe.
  pointed above, and rough and gross below
  the falling ruin crush'd cebrion's head,
  the lawless offspring of king priam's bed
  his front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound
  the bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.
  the charioteer, while yet he held the rein,
  struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.
  to the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,
  while the proud victor thus his fall derides.
   good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!
  what skilful divers are our phrygian foes!
  mark with what ease they sink into the sand!
  pity that all their practice is by land!
  then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,
  to spoil the carcase fierce patroclus flies
  swift as a lion, terrible and bold,
  that sweeps the field, depopulates the fold
  pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,
  and from his fatal courage finds his bane.
  at once bold hector leaping from his car,
  defends the body, and provokes the war.
  thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,
  two lordly rulers of the wood engage
  stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,
  and echoing roars rebellow through the shades.
  stern hector fastens on the warrior's head,
  and by the foot patroclus drags the dead
  while all around, confusion, rage, and fright,
  mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.
  so pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud
  in the deep bosom of some gloomy wood
  leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,
  the broad oaks crackle, and the sylvans groan
  this way and that, the rattling thicket bends,
  and the whole forest in one crash descends.
  not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,
  in dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.
  darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring
  now flights of arrows bounding from the string
  stones follow stones  some clatter on the fields,
  some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.
  but where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,
  sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,
  and, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!
  now flaming from the zenith, sol had driven
  his fervid orb through half the vault of heaven
  while on each host with equal tempests fell
  the showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.
  but when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,
  glad conquest rested on the grecian train.
  then from amidst the tumult and alarms,
  they draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.
  then rash patroclus with new fury glows,
  and breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.
  thrice on the press like mars himself he flew,
  and thrice three heroes at each onset slew.
  there ends thy glory! there the fates untwine
  the last, black remnant of so bright a line
  apollo dreadful stops thy middle way
  death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!
  for lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,
  approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.
  the weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel
  his eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel
  in giddy darkness  far to distance flung,
  his bounding helmet on the champaign rung.
  achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore
  that plume which never stoop'd to earth before
  long used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,
  and shade the temples of the mad divine.
  jove dooms it now on hector's helm to nod
  not long--for fate pursues him, and the god.
  his spear in shivers falls  his ample shield
  drops from his arm  his baldric strows the field
  the corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes
  loose is each joint  each nerve with horror shakes
  stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands
  such is the force of more than mortal hands!
  a dardan youth there was, well known to fame,
  from panthus sprung, euphorbus was his name
  famed for the manage of the foaming horse,
  skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course
  full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,
  while yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.
  his venturous spear first drew the hero's gore
  he struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.
  nor, though disarm'd, patroclus' fury stood
  but swift withdrew the long-protended wood.
  and turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.
  thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,
  wounded, at once, patroclus yields to fear,
  retires for succour to his social train,
  and flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.
  stern hector, as the bleeding chief he views,
  breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues
  the lance arrests him with a mortal wound
  he falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.
  with him all greece was sunk  that moment all
  her yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.
  so, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,
  the roaming lion meets a bristly boar,
  fast by the spring  they both dispute the flood,
  with flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood
  at length the sovereign savage wins the strife
  and the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.
  patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,
  so many lives effused, expires his own.
  as dying now at hector's feet he lies,
  he sternly views him, and triumphant cries
   lie there, patroclus! and with thee, the joy
  thy pride once promised, of subverting troy
  the fancied scenes of ilion wrapt in flames,
  and thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.
  unthinking man! i fought those towers to free,
  and guard that beauteous race from lords like thee
  but thou a prey to vultures shalt be made
  thy own achilles cannot lend thee aid
  though much at parting that great chief might say,
  and much enjoin thee, this important day.
  'return not, my brave friend  perhaps he said ,
  without the bloody arms of hector dead.'
  he spoke, patroclus march'd, and thus he sped.
  supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,
  with faint, expiring breath, the chief replies
   vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!
  jove's and apollo's is this deed, not thine
  to heaven is owed whate'er your own you call,
  and heaven itself disarm'd me ere my fall.
  had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,
  opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight
  by fate and phoebus was i first o'erthrown,
  euphorbus next  the third mean part thy own.
  but thou, imperious! hear my latest breath
  the gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death
  insulting man, thou shalt be soon as i
  black fate o'erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh
  even now on life's last verge i see thee stand,
  i see thee fall, and by achilles' hand.
  he faints  the soul unwilling wings her way,
   the beauteous body left a load of clay
  flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast
  a naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!
  then hector pausing, as his eyes he fed
  on the pale carcase, thus address'd the dead
   from whence this boding speech, the stern decree
  of death denounced, or why denounced to me?
  why not as well achilles' fate be given
  to hector's lance? who knows the will of heaven?
  pensive he said  then pressing as he lay
  his breathless bosom, tore the lance away
  and upwards cast the corse  the reeking spear
  he shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.
  but swift automedon with loosen'd reins
  rapt in the chariot o'er the distant plains,
  far from his rage the immortal coursers drove
  the immortal coursers were the gift of jove.
  on the cold earth divine patroclus spread,
  lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.
  great menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,
  springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.
  thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,
  fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves
  and anxious  helpless as he lies, and bare
  turns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,
  opposed to each that near the carcase came,
  his broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.
  the son of panthus, skill'd the dart to send,
  eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.
   this hand, atrides, laid patroclus low
  warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow
  to me the spoils my prowess won, resign
  depart with life, and leave the glory mine
  the trojan thus  the spartan monarch burn'd
  with generous anguish, and in scorn return'd
   laugh'st thou not, jove! from thy superior throne,
  when mortals boast of prowess not their own?
  not thus the lion glories in his might,
  nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,
  nor thus the boar  those terrors of the plain
  man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.
  but far the vainest of the boastful kind,
  these sons of panthus vent their haughty mind.
  yet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel
  this boaster's brother, hyperenor, fell
  against our arm which rashly he defied,
  vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.
  these eyes beheld him on the dust expire,
  no more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.
  presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,
  go, wait thy brother to the stygian gloom
  or, while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate
  fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.
  unmoved, euphorbus thus   that action known,
  come, for my brother's blood repay thy own.
  his weeping father claims thy destined head,
  and spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.
  on these thy conquer'd spoils i shall bestow,
  to soothe a consort's and a parent's woe.
  no longer then defer the glorious strife,
  let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.
  swift as the word the missile lance he flings
  the well-aim'd weapon on the buckler rings,
  but blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.
  on jove the father great atrides calls,
  nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,
  it pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain
  wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,
  prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.
  the shining circlets of his golden hair,
  which even the graces might be proud to wear,
  instarr'd with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,
  with dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore.
  as the young olive, in some sylvan scene,
  crown'd by fresh fountains with eternal green,
  lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,
  and plays and dances to the gentle air
  when lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades
  the tender plant, and withers all its shades
  it lies uprooted from its genial bed,
  a lovely ruin now defaced and dead
  thus young, thus beautiful, euphorbus lay,
  while the fierce spartan tore his arms away.
  proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,
  affrighted troy the towering victor flies
  flies, as before some mountain lion's ire
  the village curs and trembling swains retire,
  when o'er the slaughter'd bull they hear him roar,
  and see his jaws distil with smoking gore
  all pale with fear, at distance scatter'd round,
  they shout incessant, and the vales resound.
  meanwhile apollo view'd with envious eyes,
  and urged great hector to dispute the prize
   in mentes' shape, beneath whose martial care
  the rough ciconians learn'd the trade of war
   forbear  he cried  with fruitless speed to chase
  achilles' coursers, of ethereal race
  they stoop not, these, to mortal man's command,
  or stoop to none but great achilles' hand.
  too long amused with a pursuit so vain,
  turn, and behold the brave euphorbus slain
  by sparta slain! for ever now suppress'd
  the fire which burn'd in that undaunted breast!
  thus having spoke, apollo wing'd his flight,
  and mix'd with mortals in the toils of fight
  his words infix'd unutterable care
  deep in great hector's soul  through all the war
  he darts his anxious eye  and, instant, view'd
  the breathless hero in his blood imbued,
   forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay
  and in the victor's hands the shining prey.
  sheath'd in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,
  and sends his voice in thunder to the skies
  fierce as a flood of flame by vulcan sent,
  it flew, and fired the nations as it went.
  atrides from the voice the storm divined,
  and thus explored his own unconquer'd mind
   then shall i quit patroclus on the plain,
  slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!
  desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?
  or singly, hector and his troops attend?
  sure where such partial favour heaven bestow'd,
  to brave the hero were to brave the god
  forgive me, greece, if once i quit the field
  'tis not to hector, but to heaven i yield.
  yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,
  did but the voice of ajax reach my ear
  still would we turn, still battle on the plains,
  and give achilles all that yet remains
  of his and our patroclus--  this, no more
  the time allow'd  troy thicken'd on the shore.
  a sable scene! the terrors hector led.
  slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.
  so from the fold the unwilling lion parts,
  forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts
  he flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,
  with heart indignant and retorted eyes.
  now enter'd in the spartan ranks, he turn'd
  his manly breast, and with new fury burn'd
  o'er all the black battalions sent his view,
  and through the cloud the godlike ajax knew
  where labouring on the left the warrior stood,
  all grim in arms, and cover'd o'er with blood
  there breathing courage, where the god of day
  had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.
  to him the king   oh ajax, oh my friend!
  haste, and patroclus' loved remains defend
  the body to achilles to restore
  demands our care  alas, we can no more!
  for naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies
  and hector glories in the dazzling prize.
  he said, and touch'd his heart. the raging pair
  pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.
  already had stern hector seized his head,
  and doom'd to trojan gods the unhappy dead
  but soon as ajax rear'd his tower-like shield,
  sprung to his car, and measured back the field,
  his train to troy the radiant armour bear,
  to stand a trophy of his fame in war.
  meanwhile great ajax  his broad shield display'd
  guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade
  and now before, and now behind he stood
  thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,
  with many a step, the lioness surrounds
  her tawny young, beset by men and hounds
  elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,
  dark o'er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.
  fast by his side the generous spartan glows
  with great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.
  but glaucus, leader of the lycian aids,
  on hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids
   where now in hector shall we hector find?
  a manly form, without a manly mind.
  is this, o chief! a hero's boasted fame?
  how vain, without the merit, is the name!
  since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ
  what other methods may preserve thy troy
  'tis time to try if ilion's state can stand
  by thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand
  mean, empty boast! but shall the lycians stake
  their lives for you? those lycians you forsake?
  what from thy thankless arms can we expect?
  thy friend sarpedon proves thy base neglect
  say, shall our slaughter'd bodies guard your walls,
  while unreveng'd the great sarpedon falls?
  even where he died for troy, you left him there,
  a feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.
  on my command if any lycian wait,
  hence let him march, and give up troy to fate.
  did such a spirit as the gods impart
  impel one trojan hand or trojan heart,
   such as should burn in every soul that draws
  the sword for glory, and his country's cause
  even yet our mutual arms we might employ,
  and drag yon carcase to the walls of troy.
  oh! were patroclus ours, we might obtain
  sarpedon's arms and honour'd corse again!
  greece with achilles' friend should be repaid,
  and thus due honours purchased to his shade.
  but words are vain--let ajax once appear,
  and hector trembles and recedes with fear
  thou dar'st not meet the terrors of his eye
  and lo! already thou prepar'st to fly.
  the trojan chief with fix'd resentment eyed
  the lycian leader, and sedate replied
   say, is it just, my friend, that hector's ear
  from such a warrior such a speech should hear?
  i deem'd thee once the wisest of thy kind,
  but ill this insult suits a prudent mind.
  i shun great ajax? i desert my train?
  'tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain
  i joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,
  and hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.
  but jove's high will is ever uncontroll'd,
  the strong he withers, and confounds the bold
  now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now
  strikes the fresh garland from the victor's brow!
  come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,
  and thou be witness, if i fear to-day
  if yet a greek the sight of hector dread,
  or yet their hero dare defend the dead.
  then turning to the martial hosts, he cries
   ye trojans, dardans, lycians, and allies!
  be men, my friends, in action as in name,
  and yet be mindful of your ancient fame.
  hector in proud achilles' arms shall shine,
  torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine.
  he strode along the field, as thus he said
   the sable plumage nodded o'er his head
  swift through the spacious plain he sent a look
  one instant saw, one instant overtook
  the distant band, that on the sandy shore
  the radiant spoils to sacred ilion bore.
  there his own mail unbraced the field bestrow'd
  his train to troy convey'd the massy load.
  now blazing in the immortal arms he stands
  the work and present of celestial hands
  by aged peleus to achilles given,
  as first to peleus by the court of heaven
  his father's arms not long achilles wears,
  forbid by fate to reach his father's years.
  him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,
  the god whose thunder rends the troubled air
  beheld with pity  as apart he sat,
  and, conscious, look'd through all the scene of fate.
  he shook the sacred honours of his head
  olympus trembled, and the godhead said
   ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!
  a moment's glory  and what fates attend!
  in heavenly panoply divinely bright
  thou stand'st, and armies tremble at thy sight,
  as at achilles' self! beneath thy dart
  lies slain the great achilles' dearer part.
  thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,
  which once the greatest of mankind had worn.
  yet live! i give thee one illustrious day,
  a blaze of glory ere thou fad'st away.
  for ah! no more andromache shall come
  with joyful tears to welcome hector home
  no more officious, with endearing charms,
  from thy tired limbs unbrace pelides' arms!
  then with his sable brow he gave the nod
  that seals his word  the sanction of the god.
  the stubborn arms  by jove's command disposed
  conform'd spontaneous, and around him closed
  fill'd with the god, enlarged his members grew,
  through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,
  the blood in brisker tides began to roll,
  and mars himself came rushing on his soul.
  exhorting loud through all the field he strode,
  and look'd, and moved, achilles, or a god.
  now mesthles, glaucus, medon, he inspires,
  now phorcys, chromius, and hippothous fires
  the great thersilochus like fury found,
  asteropaeus kindled at the sound,
  and ennomus, in augury renown'd.
   hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber'd bands
  of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!
  'twas not for state we summon'd you so far,
  to boast our numbers, and the pomp of war
  ye came to fight  a valiant foe to chase,
  to save our present, and our future race.
  tor this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,
  and glean the relics of exhausted troy.
  now then, to conquer or to die prepare
  to die or conquer are the terms of war.
  whatever hand shall win patroclus slain,
  whoe'er shall drag him to the trojan train,
  with hector's self shall equal honours claim
  with hector part the spoil, and share the fame.
  fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,
  they join, they thicken, they protend their spears
  full on the greeks they drive in firm array,
  and each from ajax hopes the glorious prey
  vain hope! what numbers shall the field o'erspread,
  what victims perish round the mighty dead!
  great ajax mark'd the growing storm from far,
  and thus bespoke his brother of the war
   our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend
  and all our wars and glories at an end!
  'tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,
  condemn'd to vultures on the trojan plain
  we too must yield  the same sad fate must fall
  on thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.
  see what a tempest direful hector spreads,
  and lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!
  call on our greeks, if any hear the call,
  the bravest greeks  this hour demands them all.
  the warrior raised his voice, and wide around
  the field re-echoed the distressful sound.
   o chiefs! o princes, to whose hand is given
  the rule of men  whose glory is from heaven!
  whom with due honours both atrides grace
  ye guides and guardians of our argive race!
  all, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far,
  all, whom i see not through this cloud of war
  come all! let generous rage your arms employ,
  and save patroclus from the dogs of troy.
  oilean ajax first the voice obey'd,
  swift was his pace, and ready was his aid
  next him idomeneus, more slow with age,
  and merion, burning with a hero's rage.
  the long-succeeding numbers who can name?
  but all were greeks, and eager all for fame.
  fierce to the charge great hector led the throng
  whole troy embodied rush'd with shouts along.
  thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,
  where some swoln river disembogues his waves,
  full in the mouth is stopp'd the rushing tide,
  the boiling ocean works from side to side,
  the river trembles to his utmost shore,
  and distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.
  nor less resolved, the firm achaian band
  with brazen shields in horrid circle stand.
  jove, pouring darkness o'er the mingled fight,
  conceals the warriors' shining helms in night
  to him, the chief for whom the hosts contend
  had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend
  dead he protects him with superior care.
  nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.
  the first attack the grecians scarce sustain,
  repulsed, they yield  the trojans seize the slain.
  then fierce they rally, to revenge led on
  by the swift rage of ajax telamon.
   ajax to peleus' son the second name,
  in graceful stature next, and next in fame
  with headlong force the foremost ranks he tore
  so through the thicket bursts the mountain boar,
  and rudely scatters, for a distance round,
  the frighted hunter and the baying hound.
  the son of lethus, brave pelasgus' heir,
  hippothous, dragg'd the carcase through the war
  the sinewy ankles bored, the feet he bound
  with thongs inserted through the double wound
  inevitable fate o'ertakes the deed
  doom'd by great ajax' vengeful lance to bleed
  it cleft the helmet's brazen cheeks in twain
  the shatter'd crest and horse-hair strow the plain
  with nerves relax'd he tumbles to the ground
  the brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound
  he drops patroclus' foot, and o'er him spread,
  now lies a sad companion of the dead
  far from larissa lies, his native air,
  and ill requites his parents' tender care.
  lamented youth! in life's first bloom he fell,
  sent by great ajax to the shades of hell.
  once more at ajax hector's javelin flies
  the grecian marking, as it cut the skies,
  shunn'd the descending death  which hissing on,
  stretch'd in the dust the great iphytus' son,
  schedius the brave, of all the phocian kind
  the boldest warrior and the noblest mind
  in little panope, for strength renown'd,
  he held his seat, and ruled the realms around.
  plunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,
  and deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood
  in clanging arms the hero fell and all
  the fields resounded with his weighty fall.
  phorcys, as slain hippothous he defends,
  the telamonian lance his belly rends
  the hollow armour burst before the stroke,
  and through the wound the rushing entrails broke
  in strong convulsions panting on the sands
  he lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.
  struck at the sight, recede the trojan train
  the shouting argives strip the heroes slain.
  and now had troy, by greece compell'd to yield,
  fled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field
  greece, in her native fortitude elate,
  with jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate
  but phoebus urged  neas to the fight
  he seem'd like aged periphas to sight
   a herald in anchises' love grown old,
  revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.
  thus he-- what methods yet, o chief! remain,
  to save your troy, though heaven its fall ordain?
  there have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,
  by valour, numbers, and by arts of war,
  have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,
  and gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate
  but you, when fortune smiles, when jove declares
  his partial favour, and assists your wars,
  your shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,
  and force the unwilling god to ruin troy.
   neas through the form assumed descries
  the power conceal'd, and thus to hector cries
   oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,
  we seek our ramparts, and desert the day.
  a god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,
  and tells me, jove asserts the trojan arms.
  he spoke, and foremost to the combat flew
  the bold example all his hosts pursue.
  then, first, leocritus beneath him bled,
  in vain beloved by valiant lycomede
  who view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance,
  swift to revenge it sent his angry lance
  the whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd,
  descends, and pants in apisaon's breast
  from rich paeonia's vales the warrior came,
  next thee, asteropeus! in place and fame.
  asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,
  and rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain
  indissolubly firm, around the dead,
  rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,
  and hemm'd with bristled spears, the grecians stood,
  a brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.
  great ajax eyes them with incessant care,
  and in an orb contracts the crowded war,
  close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,
  and stands the centre and the soul of all
  fix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound
  a sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground
  on heaps the greeks, on heaps the trojans bled,
  and, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.
  greece, in close order, and collected might,
  yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight
  fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,
  and now it rises, now it sinks by turns.
  in one thick darkness all the fight was lost
  the sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host
  seem'd as extinct  day ravish'd from their eyes,
  and all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.
  such o'er patroclus' body hung the night,
  the rest in sunshine fought, and open light
  unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,
  no vapour rested on the mountain's head,
  the golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray,
  and all the broad expansion flamed with day.
  dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,
  and here and there their scatter'd arrows light
  but death and darkness o'er the carcase spread,
  there burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.
  meanwhile the sons of nestor, in the rear,
   their fellows routed,  toss the distant spear,
  and skirmish wide  so nestor gave command,
  when from the ships he sent the pylian band.
  the youthful brothers thus for fame contend,
  nor knew the fortune of achilles' friend
  in thought they view'd him still, with martial joy,
  glorious in arms, and dealing death to troy.
  but round the corse the heroes pant for breath,
  and thick and heavy grows the work of death
  o'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,
  their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er
  drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,
  and carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.
  as when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide,
  strain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side,
  the brawny curriers stretch  and labour o'er
  the extended surface, drunk with fat and gore
  so tugging round the corse both armies stood
  the mangled body bathed in sweat and blood
  while greeks and ilians equal strength employ,
  now to the ships to force it, now to troy.
  not pallas' self, her breast when fury warms,
  nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,
  could blame this scene  such rage, such horror reign'd
  such, jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.
  achilles in his ships at distance lay,
  nor knew the fatal fortune of the day
  he, yet unconscious of patroclus' fall,
  in dust extended under ilion's wall,
  expects him glorious from the conquered plain,
  and for his wish'd return prepares in vain
  though well he knew, to make proud ilion bend
  was more than heaven had destined to his friend.
  perhaps to him  this thetis had reveal'd
  the rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.
  still raged the conflict round the hero dead,
  and heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.
   cursed be the man  even private greeks would say
  who dares desert this well-disputed day!
  first may the cleaving earth before our eyes
  gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice
  first perish all, ere haughty troy shall boast
  we lost patroclus, and our glory lost!
  thus they  while with one voice the trojans said,
   grant this day, jove! or heap us on the dead!
  then clash their sounding arms  the clangours rise,
  and shake the brazen concave of the skies.
  meantime, at distance from the scene of blood,
  the pensive steeds of great achilles stood
  their godlike master slain before their eyes,
  they wept, and shared in human miseries.
  in vain automedon now shakes the rein,
  now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain
  nor to the fight nor hellespont they go,
  restive they stood, and obstinate in woe
  still as a tombstone, never to be moved,
  on some good man or woman unreproved
  lays its eternal weight  or fix'd, as stands
  a marble courser by the sculptor's hands,
  placed on the hero's grave. along their face
  the big round drops coursed down with silent pace,
  conglobing on the dust. their manes, that late
  circled their arched necks, and waved in state,
  trail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,
  and prone to earth was hung their languid head
  nor jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,
  while thus relenting to the steeds he spoke
   unhappy coursers of immortal strain,
  exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain
  did we your race on mortal man bestow,
  only, alas! to share in mortal woe?
  for ah! what is there of inferior birth,
  that breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth
  what wretched creature of what wretched kind,
  than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?
  a miserable race! but cease to mourn
  for not by you shall priam's son be borne
  high on the splendid car  one glorious prize
  he rashly boasts  the rest our will denies.
  ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,
  ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.
  automedon your rapid flight shall bear
  safe to the navy through the storm of war.
  for yet 'tis given to troy to ravage o'er
  the field, and spread her slaughters to the shore
  the sun shall see her conquer, till his fall
  with sacred darkness shades the face of all.
  he said  and breathing in the immortal horse
  excessive spirit, urged them to the course
  from their high manes they shake the dust, and bear
  the kindling chariot through the parted war
  so flies a vulture through the clamorous train
  of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.
  from danger now with swiftest speed they flew,
  and now to conquest with like speed pursue
  sole in the seat the charioteer remains,
  now plies the javelin, now directs the reins
  him brave alcimedon beheld distress'd,
  approach'd the chariot, and the chief address'd
   what god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,
  alone, unaided, in the thickest war?
  alas! thy friend is slain, and hector wields
  achilles' arms triumphant in the fields.
   in happy time  the charioteer replies
  the bold alcimedon now greets my eyes
  no greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,
  or holds their fury in suspended reins
  patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,
  but now patroclus is an empty name!
  to thee i yield the seat, to thee resign
  the ruling charge  the task of fight be mine.
  he said. alcimedon, with active heat,
  snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.
  his friend descends. the chief of troy descried,
  and call'd  neas fighting near his side.
   lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,
  achilles' car, deserted of its lord!
  the glorious steeds our ready arms invite,
  scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.
  can such opponents stand when we assail?
  unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.
  the son of venus to the counsel yields
  then o'er their backs they spread their solid shields
  with brass refulgent the broad surface shined,
  and thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.
  them chromius follows, aretus succeeds
  each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds
  in vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,
  in vain advance! not fated to return.
  unmov'd, automedon attends the fight,
  implores the eternal, and collects his might.
  then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind
   oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!
  full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,
  for hard the fight, determined is the foe
  'tis hector comes  and when he seeks the prize,
  war knows no mean  he wins it or he dies.
  then through the field he sends his voice aloud,
  and calls the ajaces from the warring crowd,
  with great atrides.  hither turn,  he said,
  turn where distress demands immediate aid
  the dead, encircled by his friends, forego,
  and save the living from a fiercer foe.
  unhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage
  the force of hector, and  neas' rage
  yet mighty as they are, my force to prove
  is only mine  the event belongs to jove.
  he spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,
  which pass'd the shield of aretus the young
  it pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art,
  then in the lower belly struck the dart.
  as when a ponderous axe, descending full,
  cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull
  struck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,
  then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground
  thus fell the youth  the air his soul received,
  and the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.
  now at automedon the trojan foe
  discharged his lance  the meditated blow,
  stooping, he shunn'd  the javelin idly fled,
  and hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head
  deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear
  in long vibrations spent its fury there.
  with clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,
  but each brave ajax heard, and interposed
  nor longer hector with his trojans stood,
  but left their slain companion in his blood
  his arms automedon divests, and cries,
   accept, patroclus, this mean sacrifice
  thus have i soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,
  poor as it is, some offering to thy shade.
  so looks the lion o'er a mangled boar,
  all grim with rage, and horrible with gore
  high on the chariot at one bound he sprung,
  and o'er his seat the bloody trophies hung.
  and now minerva from the realms of air
  descends impetuous, and renews the war
  for, pleased at length the grecian arms to aid,
  the lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.
  as when high jove denouncing future woe,
  o'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,
   in sign of tempests from the troubled air,
  or from the rage of man, destructive war,
  the drooping cattle dread the impending skies,
  and from his half-till'd field the labourer flies
  in such a form the goddess round her drew
  a livid cloud, and to the battle flew.
  assuming phoenix' shape on earth she falls,
  and in his well-known voice to sparta calls
   and lies achilles' friend, beloved by all,
  a prey to dogs beneath the trojan wall?
  what shame 'o greece for future times to tell,
  to thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!
   o chief, o father!  atreus' son replies
  o full of days! by long experience wise!
  what more desires my soul, than here unmoved
  to guard the body of the man i loved?
  ah, would minerva send me strength to rear
  this wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!
  but hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,
  and jove's own glories blaze around his head!
  pleased to be first of all the powers address'd,
  she breathes new vigour in her hero's breast,
  and fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,
  desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.
  so burns the vengeful hornet  soul all o'er ,
  repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore
   bold son of air and heat  on angry wings
  untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.
  fired with like ardour fierce atrides flew,
  and sent his soul with every lance he threw.
  there stood a trojan, not unknown to fame,
  aetion's son, and podes was his name
  with riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd,
  by hector loved, his comrade, and his guest
  through his broad belt the spear a passage found,
  and, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.
  sudden at hector's side apollo stood,
  like phaenops, asius' son, appear'd the god
   asius the great, who held his wealthy reign
  in fair abydos, by the rolling main.
   oh prince!  he cried  oh foremost once in fame!
  what grecian now shall tremble at thy name?
  dost thou at length to menelaus yield,
  a chief once thought no terror of the field?
  yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize
  he bears victorious, while our army flies
  by the same arm illustrious podes bled
  the friend of hector, unrevenged, is dead!
  this heard, o'er hector spreads a cloud of woe,
  rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.
  but now the eternal shook his sable shield,
  that shaded ide and all the subject field
  beneath its ample verge. a rolling cloud
  involved the mount  the thunder roar'd aloud
  the affrighted hills from their foundations nod,
  and blaze beneath the lightnings of the god
  at one regard of his all-seeing eye
  the vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly.
  then trembled greece  the flight peneleus led
  for as the brave boeotian turn'd his head
  to face the foe, polydamas drew near,
  and razed his shoulder with a shorten'd spear
  by hector wounded, leitus quits the plain,
  pierced through the wrist  and raging with the pain,
  grasps his once formidable lance in vain.
  as hector follow'd, idomen address'd
  the flaming javelin to his manly breast
  the brittle point before his corslet yields
  exulting troy with clamour fills the fields
  high on his chariots the cretan stood,
  the son of priam whirl'd the massive wood.
  but erring from its aim, the impetuous spear
  struck to the dust the squire and charioteer
  of martial merion  coeranus his name,
  who left fair lyctus for the fields of fame.
  on foot bold merion fought  and now laid low,
  had graced the triumphs of his trojan foe,
  but the brave squire the ready coursers brought,
  and with his life his master's safety bought.
  between his cheek and ear the weapon went,
  the teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent.
  prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain
  his dying hand forgets the falling rein
  this merion reaches, bending from the car,
  and urges to desert the hopeless war
  idomeneus consents  the lash applies
  and the swift chariot to the navy flies.
  not ajax less the will of heaven descried,
  and conquest shifting to the trojan side,
  turn'd by the hand of jove. then thus begun,
  to atreus's seed, the godlike telamon
   alas! who sees not jove's almighty hand
  transfers the glory to the trojan band?
  whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,
  he guides each arrow to a grecian heart
  not so our spears  incessant though they rain,
  he suffers every lance to fall in vain.
  deserted of the god, yet let us try
  what human strength and prudence can supply
  if yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne,
  may glad the fleets that hope not our return,
  who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,
  and still hear hector thundering at their gates.
  some hero too must be despatch'd to bear
  the mournful message to pelides' ear
  for sure he knows not, distant on the shore,
  his friend, his loved patroclus, is no more.
  but such a chief i spy not through the host
  the men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost
  in general darkness--lord of earth and air!
  oh king! oh father! hear my humble prayer
  dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore
  give me to see, and ajax asks no more
  if greece must perish, we thy will obey,
  but let us perish in the face of day!
  with tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer
  the god relenting clear'd the clouded air
  forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray
  the blaze of armour flash'd against the day.
   now, now, atrides! cast around thy sight
  if yet antilochus survives the fight,
  let him to great achilles' ear convey
  the fatal news --atrides hastes away.
  so turns the lion from the nightly fold,
  though high in courage, and with hunger bold,
  long gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds,
  stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds
  the darts fly round him from a hundred hands,
  and the red terrors of the blazing brands
  till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day
  sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,
  so moved atrides from his dangerous place
  with weary limbs, but with unwilling pace
  the foe, he fear'd, might yet patroclus gain,
  and much admonish'd, much adjured his train
   o guard these relics to your charge consign'd,
  and bear the merits of the dead in mind
  how skill'd he was in each obliging art
  the mildest manners, and the gentlest heart
  he was, alas! but fate decreed his end,
  in death a hero, as in life a friend!
  so parts the chief  from rank to rank he flew,
  and round on all sides sent his piercing view.
  as the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye
  of all that wings the mid aerial sky,
  the sacred eagle, from his walks above
  looks down, and sees the distant thicket move
  then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,
  snatches his life amid the clouds of air.
  not with less quickness, his exerted sight
  pass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight
  till on the left the chief he sought, he found,
  cheering his men, and spreading deaths around
  to him the king   beloved of jove! draw near,
  for sadder tidings never touch'd thy ear
  thy eyes have witness'd what a fatal turn!
  how ilion triumphs, and the achaians mourn.
  this is not all  patroclus, on the shore
  now pale and dead, shall succour greece no more.
  fly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell
  the sad achilles, how his loved-one fell
  he too may haste the naked corse to gain
  the arms are hector's, who despoil'd the slain.
  the youthful warrior heard with silent woe,
  from his fair eyes the tears began to flow
  big with the mighty grief, he strove to say
  what sorrow dictates, but no word found way.
  to brave laodocus his arms he flung,
  who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along
  then ran the mournful message to impart,
  with tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.
  swift fled the youth  nor menelaus stands
   though sore distress'd  to aid the pylian bands
  but bids bold thrasymede those troops sustain
  himself returns to his patroclus slain.
   gone is antilochus  the hero said
  but hope not, warriors, for achilles' aid
  though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,
  unarm'd, he fights not with the trojan foe.
  'tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,
  'tis our own vigour must the dead regain,
  and save ourselves, while with impetuous hate
  troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.
   'tis well  said ajax , be it then thy care,
  with merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear
  myself, and my bold brother will sustain
  the shock of hector and his charging train
  nor fear we armies, fighting side by side
  what troy can dare, we have already tried,
  have tried it, and have stood.  the hero said.
  high from the ground the warriors heave the dead.
  a general clamour rises at the sight
  loud shout the trojans, and renew the fight.
  not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,
  with rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,
  voracious hounds, that many a length before
  their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar
  but if the savage turns his glaring eye,
  they howl aloof, and round the forest fly.
  thus on retreating greece the trojans pour,
  wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower
  but ajax turning, to their fears they yield,
  all pale they tremble and forsake the field.
  while thus aloft the hero's corse they bear,
  behind them rages all the storm of war
  confusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng
  of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along
  less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire
  to whelm some city under waves of fire
  now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,
  now crack the blazing temples of the gods
  the rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,
  and sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.
  the heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load
  as when two mules, along the rugged road,
  from the steep mountain with exerted strength
  drag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length
  inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,
  the enormous timber lumbering down the hill
  so these--behind, the bulk of ajax stands,
  and breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.
  thus when a river swell'd with sudden rains
  spreads his broad waters o'er the level plains,
  some interposing hill the stream divides.
  and breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.
  still close they follow, close the rear engage
  aeneas storms, and hector foams with rage
  while greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,
  wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,
  that shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung
  high on poised pinions, threats their callow young.
  so from the trojan chiefs the grecians fly,
  such the wild terror, and the mingled cry
  within, without the trench, and all the way,
  strow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay
  such horror jove impress'd! yet still proceeds
  the work of death, and still the battle bleeds.
  thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,
  and now it rises, now it sinks by turns.
  meanwhile, where hellespont's broad waters flow,
  stood nestor's son, the messenger of woe
  there sat achilles, shaded by his sails,
  on hoisted yards extended to the gales
  pensive he sat  for all that fate design'd
  rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.
  thus to his soul he said   ah! what constrains
  the greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?
  is this the day, which heaven so long ago
  ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe?
   so thetis warn'd   when by a trojan hand
  the bravest of the myrmidonian band
  should lose the light! fulfilled is that decree
  fallen is the warrior, and patroclus he!
  in vain i charged him soon to quit the plain,
  and warn'd to shun hectorean force in vain!
  thus while he thinks, antilochus appears,
  and tells the melancholy tale with tears.
   sad tidings, son of peleus! thou must hear
  and wretched i, the unwilling messenger!
  dead is patroclus! for his corse they fight
  his naked corse  his arms are hector's right.
  a sudden horror shot through all the chief,
  and wrapp'd his senses in the cloud of grief
  cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread
  the scorching ashes o'er his graceful head
  his purple garments, and his golden hairs,
  those he deforms with dust, and these he tears
  on the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,
  and roll'd and grovell'd, as to earth he grew.
  the virgin captives, with disorder'd charms,
   won by his own, or by patroclus' arms,
  rush'd from their tents with cries  and gathering round,
  beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground
  while nestor's son sustains a manlier part,
  and mourns the warrior with a warrior's heart
  hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe,
  and oft prevents the meditated blow.
  far in the deep abysses of the main,
  with hoary nereus, and the watery train,
  the mother-goddess from her crystal throne
  heard his loud cries, and answer'd groan for groan.
  the circling nereids with their mistress weep,
  and all the sea-green sisters of the deep.
  thalia, glauce  every watery name ,
  nesaea mild, and silver spio came
  cymothoe and cymodoce were nigh,
  and the blue languish of soft alia's eye.
  their locks actaea and limnoria rear,
  then proto, doris, panope appear,
  thoa, pherusa, doto, melita
  agave gentle, and amphithoe gay
  next callianira, callianassa show
  their sister looks  dexamene the slow,
  and swift dynamene, now cut the tides
  iaera now the verdant wave divides
  nemertes with apseudes lifts the head,
  bright galatea quits her pearly bed
  these orythia, clymene, attend,
  maera, amphinome, the train extend
  and black janira, and janassa fair,
  and amatheia with her amber hair.
  all these, and all that deep in ocean held
  their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill'd
  each beat her ivory breast with silent woe,
  till thetis' sorrows thus began to flow
   hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!
  how just a cause has thetis to complain!
  how wretched, were i mortal, were my fate!
  how more than wretched in the immortal state!
  sprung from my bed a godlike hero came,
  the bravest far that ever bore the name
  like some fair olive, by my careful hand
  he grew, he flourish'd and adorn'd the land
  to troy i sent him  but the fates ordain
  he never, never must return again.
  so short a space the light of heaven to view,
  so short, alas! and fill'd with anguish too!
  hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!
  i cannot ease them, but i must deplore
  i go at least to bear a tender part,
  and mourn my loved-one with a mother's heart.
  she said, and left the caverns of the main,
  all bathed in tears  the melancholy train
  attend her way. wide-opening part the tides,
  while the long pomp the silver wave divides.
  approaching now, they touch'd the trojan land
  then, two by two, ascended up the strand.
  the immortal mother, standing close beside
  her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied
  along the coast their mingled clamours ran,
  and thus the silver-footed dame began
   why mourns my son? thy late preferr'd request
  the god has granted, and the greeks distress'd
  why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,
  reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care.
  he, deeply groaning-- to this cureless grief,
  not even the thunderer's favour brings relief.
  patroclus--ah!--say, goddess, can i boast
  a pleasure now? revenge itself is lost
  patroclus, loved of all my martial train,
  beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!
  lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow'd
  on peleus  hector bears the glorious load.
  cursed be that day, when all the powers above
  thy charms submitted to a mortal love
  o hadst thou still, a sister of the main,
  pursued the pleasures of the watery reign
  and happier peleus, less ambitious, led
  a mortal beauty to his equal bed!
  ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb
  had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.
  for soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,
  new woes, new sorrows, shall create again.
  'tis not in fate the alternate now to give
  patroclus dead, achilles hates to live.
  let me revenge it on proud hector's heart,
  let his last spirit smoke upon my dart
  on these conditions will i breathe  till then,
  i blush to walk among the race of men.
  a flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed
   ah then, i see thee dying, see thee dead!
  when hector falls, thou diest. -- let hector die,
  and let me fall!  achilles made reply
  far lies patroclus from his native plain!
  he fell, and falling, wish'd my aid in vain.
  ah then, since from this miserable day
  i cast all hope of my return away
  since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand
  the fate of hector from achilles' hand
  since here, for brutal courage far renown'd,
  i live an idle burden to the ground,
   others in council famed for nobler skill,
  more useful to preserve, than i to kill,
  let me--but oh! ye gracious powers above!
  wrath and revenge from men and gods remove
  far, far too dear to every mortal breast,
  sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste
  gathering like vapours of a noxious kind
  from fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.
  me agamemnon urged to deadly hate
  'tis past--i quell it  i resign to fate.
  yes--i will meet the murderer of my friend
  or  if the gods ordain it  meet my end.
  the stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun
  the great alcides, jove's unequall'd son,
  to juno's hate, at length resign'd his breath,
  and sunk the victim of all-conquering death.
  so shall achilles fall! stretch'd pale and dead,
  no more the grecian hope, or trojan dread!
  let me, this instant, rush into the fields,
  and reap what glory life's short harvest yields.
  shall i not force some widow'd dame to tear
  with frantic hands her long dishevell'd hair?
  shall i not force her breast to heave with sighs,
  and the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?
  yes, i shall give the fair those mournful charms--
  in vain you hold me--hence! my arms! my arms!--
  soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide,
  that all shall know achilles swells the tide.
   my son  coerulean thetis made reply,
  to fate submitting with a secret sigh,
  the host to succour, and thy friends to save,
  is worthy thee  the duty of the brave.
  but canst thou, naked, issue to the plains?
  thy radiant arms the trojan foe detains.
  insulting hector bears the spoils on high,
  but vainly glories, for his fate is nigh.
  yet, yet awhile thy generous ardour stay
  assured, i meet thee at the dawn of day,
  charged with refulgent arms  a glorious load ,
  vulcanian arms, the labour of a god.
  then turning to the daughters of the main,
  the goddess thus dismiss'd her azure train
   ye sister nereids! to your deeps descend
  haste, and our father's sacred seat attend
  i go to find the architect divine,
  where vast olympus' starry summits shine
  so tell our hoary sire --this charge she gave
  the sea-green sisters plunge beneath the wave
  thetis once more ascends the bless'd abodes,
  and treads the brazen threshold of the gods.
  and now the greeks from furious hector's force,
  urge to broad hellespont their headlong course
  nor yet their chiefs patroclus' body bore
  safe through the tempest to the tented shore.
  the horse, the foot, with equal fury join'd,
  pour'd on the rear, and thunder'd close behind
  and like a flame through fields of ripen'd corn,
  the rage of hector o'er the ranks was borne.
  thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew
  thrice to the skies the trojan clamours flew
  as oft the ajaces his assault sustain
  but check'd, he turns  repuls'd, attacks again.
  with fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires,
  nor yields a step, nor from his post retires
  so watchful shepherds strive to force, in vain,
  the hungry lion from a carcase slain.
  even yet patroclus had he borne away,
  and all the glories of the extended day,
  had not high juno from the realms of air,
  secret, despatch'd her trusty messenger.
  the various goddess of the showery bow,
  shot in a whirlwind to the shore below
  to great achilles at his ships she came,
  and thus began the many-colour'd dame
   rise, son of peleus! rise, divinely brave!
  assist the combat, and patroclus save
  for him the slaughter to the fleet they spread,
  and fall by mutual wounds around the dead.
  to drag him back to troy the foe contends
  nor with his death the rage of hector ends
  a prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lie,
  and marks the place to fix his head on high.
  rise, and prevent  if yet you think of fame
  thy friend's disgrace, thy own eternal shame!
   who sends thee, goddess, from the ethereal skies?
  achilles thus. and iris thus replies
   i come, pelides! from the queen of jove,
  the immortal empress of the realms above
  unknown to him who sits remote on high,
  unknown to all the synod of the sky.
   thou comest in vain  he cries, with fury warm'd
  arms i have none, and can i fight unarm'd?
  unwilling as i am, of force i stay,
  till thetis bring me at the dawn of day
  vulcanian arms  what other can i wield,
  except the mighty telamonian shield?
  that, in my friend's defence, has ajax spread,
  while his strong lance around him heaps the dead
  the gallant chief defends menoetius' son,
  and does what his achilles should have done.
   thy want of arms  said iris  well we know
  but though unarm'd, yet clad in terrors, go!
  let but achilles o'er yon trench appear,
  proud troy shall tremble, and consent to fear
  greece from one glance of that tremendous eye
  shall take new courage, and disdain to fly.
  she spoke, and pass'd in air. the hero rose
  her aegis pallas o'er his shoulder throws
  around his brows a golden cloud she spread
  a stream of glory flamed above his head.
  as when from some beleaguer'd town arise
  the smokes, high curling to the shaded skies
   seen from some island, o'er the main afar,
  when men distress'd hang out the sign of war
  soon as the sun in ocean hides his rays,
  thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze
  with long-projected beams the seas are bright,
  and heaven's high arch reflects the ruddy light
  so from achilles' head the splendours rise,
  reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies.
  forth march'd the chief, and distant from the crowd,
  high on the rampart raised his voice aloud
  with her own shout minerva swells the sound
  troy starts astonish'd, and the shores rebound.
  as the loud trumpet's brazen mouth from far
  with shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war,
  struck from the walls, the echoes float on high,
  and the round bulwarks and thick towers reply
  so high his brazen voice the hero rear'd
  hosts dropp'd their arms, and trembled as they heard
  and back the chariots roll, and coursers bound,
  and steeds and men lie mingled on the ground.
  aghast they see the living lightnings play,
  and turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray.
  thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised,
  and thrice they fled, confounded and amazed.
  twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely rush'd
  on their own spears, by their own chariots crush'd
  while, shielded from the darts, the greeks obtain
  the long-contended carcase of the slain.
  a lofty bier the breathless warrior bears
  around, his sad companions melt in tears.
  but chief achilles, bending down his head,
  pours unavailing sorrows o'er the dead,
  whom late triumphant, with his steeds and car,
  he sent refulgent to the field of war
   unhappy change!  now senseless, pale, he found,
  stretch'd forth, and gash'd with many a gaping wound.
  meantime, unwearied with his heavenly way,
  in ocean's waves the unwilling light of day
  quench'd his red orb, at juno's high command,
  and from their labours eased the achaian band.
  the frighted trojans  panting from the war,
  their steeds unharness'd from the weary car
  a sudden council call'd  each chief appear'd
  in haste, and standing  for to sit they fear'd.
  'twas now no season for prolong'd debate
  they saw achilles, and in him their fate.
  silent they stood  polydamas at last,
  skill'd to discern the future by the past,
  the son of panthus, thus express'd his fears
   the friend of hector, and of equal years
  the self-same night to both a being gave,
  one wise in council, one in action brave
   in free debate, my friends, your sentence speak
  for me, i move, before the morning break,
  to raise our camp  too dangerous here our post,
  far from troy walls, and on a naked coast.
  i deem'd not greece so dreadful, while engaged
  in mutual feuds her king and hero raged
  then, while we hoped our armies might prevail
  we boldly camp'd beside a thousand sail.
  i dread pelides now  his rage of mind
  not long continues to the shores confined,
  nor to the fields, where long in equal fray
  contending nations won and lost the day
  for troy, for troy, shall henceforth be the strife,
  and the hard contest not for fame, but life.
  haste then to ilion, while the favouring night
  detains these terrors, keeps that arm from fight.
  if but the morrow's sun behold us here,
  that arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear
  and hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy,
  if heaven permit them then to enter troy.
  let not my fatal prophecy be true,
  nor what i tremble but to think, ensue.
  whatever be our fate, yet let us try
  what force of thought and reason can supply
  let us on counsel for our guard depend
  the town her gates and bulwarks shall defend.
  when morning dawns, our well-appointed powers,
  array'd in arms, shall line the lofty towers.
  let the fierce hero, then, when fury calls,
  vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls,
  or fetch a thousand circles round the plain,
  till his spent coursers seek the fleet again
  so may his rage be tired, and labour'd down!
  and dogs shall tear him ere he sack the town.
   return!  said hector, fired with stern disdain
  what! coop whole armies in our walls again?
  was't not enough, ye valiant warriors, say,
  nine years imprison'd in those towers ye lay?
  wide o'er the world was ilion famed of old
  for brass exhaustless, and for mines of gold
  but while inglorious in her walls we stay'd,
  sunk were her treasures, and her stores decay'd
  the phrygians now her scatter'd spoils enjoy,
  and proud maeonia wastes the fruits of troy.
  great jove at length my arms to conquest calls,
  and shuts the grecians in their wooden walls,
  darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite?
  flies any trojan? i shall stop his flight.
  to better counsel then attention lend
  take due refreshment, and the watch attend.
  if there be one whose riches cost him care,
  forth let him bring them for the troops to share
  'tis better generously bestow'd on those,
  than left the plunder of our country's foes.
  soon as the morn the purple orient warms,
  fierce on yon navy will we pour our arms.
  if great achilles rise in all his might,
  his be the danger  i shall stand the fight.
  honour, ye gods! or let me gain or give
  and live he glorious, whosoe'er shall live!
  mars is our common lord, alike to all
  and oft the victor triumphs, but to fall.
  the shouting host in loud applauses join'd
  so pallas robb'd the many of their mind
  to their own sense condemn'd, and left to choose
  the worst advice, the better to refuse.
  while the long night extends her sable reign,
  around patroclus mourn'd the grecian train.
  stern in superior grief pelides stood
  those slaughtering arms, so used to bathe in blood,
  now clasp his clay-cold limbs  then gushing start
  the tears, and sighs burst from his swelling heart.
  the lion thus, with dreadful anguish stung,
  roars through the desert, and demands his young
  when the grim savage, to his rifled den
  too late returning, snuffs the track of men,
  and o'er the vales and o'er the forest bounds
  his clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds.
  so grieves achilles  and, impetuous, vents
  to all his myrmidons his loud laments.
   in what vain promise, gods! did i engage,
  when to console menoetius' feeble age,
  i vowed his much-loved offspring to restore,
  charged with rich spoils, to fair opuntia's shore?
  but mighty jove cuts short, with just disdain,
  the long, long views of poor designing man!
  one fate the warrior and the friend shall strike,
  and troy's black sands must drink our blood alike
  me too a wretched mother shall deplore,
  an aged father never see me more!
  yet, my patroclus! yet a space i stay,
  then swift pursue thee on the darksome way.
  ere thy dear relics in the grave are laid,
  shall hector's head be offer'd to thy shade
  that, with his arms, shall hang before thy shrine
  and twelve, the noblest of the trojan line,
  sacred to vengeance, by this hand expire
  their lives effused around thy flaming pyre.
  thus let me lie till then! thus, closely press'd,
  bathe thy cold face, and sob upon thy breast!
  while trojan captives here thy mourners stay,
  weep all the night and murmur all the day
  spoils of my arms, and thine  when, wasting wide,
  our swords kept time, and conquer'd side by side.
  he spoke, and bade the sad attendants round
  cleanse the pale corse, and wash each honour'd wound.
  a massy caldron of stupendous frame
  they brought, and placed it o'er the rising flame
  then heap'd the lighted wood  the flame divides
  beneath the vase, and climbs around the sides
  in its wide womb they pour the rushing stream
  the boiling water bubbles to the brim.
  the body then they bathe with pious toil,
  embalm the wounds, anoint the limbs with oil,
  high on a bed of state extended laid,
  and decent cover'd with a linen shade
  last o'er the dead the milk-white veil they threw
  that done, their sorrows and their sighs renew.
  meanwhile to juno, in the realms above,
   his wife and sister,  spoke almighty jove.
   at last thy will prevails  great peleus' son
  rises in arms  such grace thy greeks have won.
  say  for i know not , is their race divine,
  and thou the mother of that martial line?
   what words are these?  the imperial dame replies,
  while anger flash'd from her majestic eyes
  succour like this a mortal arm might lend,
  and such success mere human wit attend
  and shall not i, the second power above,
  heaven's queen, and consort of the thundering jove,
  say, shall not i one nation's fate command,
  not wreak my vengeance on one guilty land?
  so they. meanwhile the silver-footed dame
  reach'd the vulcanian dome, eternal frame!
  high-eminent amid the works divine,
  where heaven's far-beaming brazen mansions shine.
  there the lame architect the goddess found,
  obscure in smoke, his forges flaming round,
  while bathed in sweat from fire to fire he flew
  and puffing loud, the roaring billows blew.
  that day no common task his labour claim'd
  full twenty tripods for his hall he framed,
  that placed on living wheels of massy gold,
   wondrous to tell,  instinct with spirit roll'd
  from place to place, around the bless'd abodes
  self-moved, obedient to the beck of gods
  for their fair handles now, o'erwrought with flowers,
  in moulds prepared, the glowing ore he pours.
  just as responsive to his thought the frame
  stood prompt to move, the azure goddess came
  charis, his spouse, a grace divinely fair,
   with purple fillets round her braided hair,
  observed her entering  her soft hand she press'd,
  and, smiling, thus the watery queen address'd
   what, goddess! this unusual favour draws?
  all hail, and welcome! whatsoe'er the cause
  till now a stranger, in a happy hour
  approach, and taste the dainties of the bower.
  high on a throne, with stars of silver graced,
  and various artifice, the queen she placed
  a footstool at her feet  then calling, said,
   vulcan, draw near, 'tis thetis asks your aid.
   thetis  replied the god  our powers may claim,
  an ever-dear, an ever-honour'd name!
  when my proud mother hurl'd me from the sky,
   my awkward form, it seems, displeased her eye,
  she, and eurynome, my griefs redress'd,
  and soft received me on their silver breast.
  even then these arts employ'd my infant thought
  chains, bracelets, pendants, all their toys, i wrought.
  nine years kept secret in the dark abode,
  secure i lay, conceal'd from man and god
  deep in a cavern'd rock my days were led
  the rushing ocean murmur'd o'er my head.
  now, since her presence glads our mansion, say,
  for such desert what service can i pay?
  vouchsafe, o thetis! at our board to share
  the genial rites, and hospitable fare
  while i the labours of the forge forego,
  and bid the roaring bellows cease to blow.
  then from his anvil the lame artist rose
  wide with distorted legs oblique he goes,
  and stills the bellows, and  in order laid
  locks in their chests his instruments of trade.
  then with a sponge the sooty workman dress'd
  his brawny arms embrown'd, and hairy breast.
  with his huge sceptre graced, and red attire,
  came halting forth the sovereign of the fire
  the monarch's steps two female forms uphold,
  that moved and breathed in animated gold
  to whom was voice, and sense, and science given
  of works divine  such wonders are in heaven!
  on these supported, with unequal gait,
  he reach'd the throne where pensive thetis sate
  there placed beside her on the shining frame,
  he thus address'd the silver-footed dame
   thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls
   so long a stranger  to these honour'd walls?
  'tis thine, fair thetis, the command to lay,
  and vulcan's joy and duty to obey.
  to whom the mournful mother thus replies
   the crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes
   o vulcan! say, was ever breast divine
  so pierced with sorrows, so o'erwhelm'd as mine?
  of all the goddesses, did jove prepare
  for thetis only such a weight of care?
  i, only i, of all the watery race
  by force subjected to a man's embrace,
  who, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays
  the mighty fine imposed on length of days.
  sprung from my bed, a godlike hero came,
  the bravest sure that ever bore the name
  like some fair plant beneath my careful hand
  he grew, he flourish'd, and he graced the land
  to troy i sent him! but his native shore
  never, ah never, shall receive him more
   even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe
  nor i, a goddess, can retard the blow!
  robb'd of the prize the grecian suffrage gave,
  the king of nations forced his royal slave
  for this he grieved  and, till the greeks oppress'd
  required his arm, he sorrow'd unredress'd.
  large gifts they promise, and their elders send
  in vain--he arms not, but permits his friend
  his arms, his steeds, his forces to employ
  he marches, combats, almost conquers troy
  then slain by phoebus  hector had the name
  at once resigns his armour, life, and fame.
  but thou, in pity, by my prayer be won
  grace with immortal arms this short-lived son,
  and to the field in martial pomp restore,
  to shine with glory, till he shines no more!
  to her the artist-god   thy griefs resign,
  secure, what vulcan can, is ever thine.
  o could i hide him from the fates, as well,
  or with these hands the cruel stroke repel,
  as i shall forge most envied arms, the gaze
  of wondering ages, and the world's amaze!
  thus having said, the father of the fires
  to the black labours of his forge retires.
  soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn'd
  their iron mouths  and where the furnace burn'd,
  resounding breathed  at once the blast expires,
  and twenty forges catch at once the fires
  just as the god directs, now loud, now low,
  they raise a tempest, or they gently blow
  in hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd,
  and stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold
  before, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand
  the ponderous hammer loads his better hand,
  his left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round,
  and thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.
  then first he form'd the immense and solid shield
  rich various artifice emblazed the field
  its utmost verge a threefold circle bound
  a silver chain suspends the massy round
  five ample plates the broad expanse compose,
  and godlike labours on the surface rose.
  there shone the image of the master-mind
  there earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd
  the unwearied sun, the moon completely round
  the starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd
  the pleiads, hyads, with the northern team
  and great orion's more refulgent beam
  to which, around the axle of the sky,
  the bear, revolving, points his golden eye,
  still shines exalted on the ethereal plain,
  nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.
  two cities radiant on the shield appear,
  the image one of peace, and one of war.
  here sacred pomp and genial feast delight,
  and solemn dance, and hymeneal rite
  along the street the new-made brides are led,
  with torches flaming, to the nuptial bed
  the youthful dancers in a circle bound
  to the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound
  through the fair streets the matrons in a row
  stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.
  there in the forum swarm a numerous train
  the subject of debate, a townsman slain
  one pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,
  and bade the public and the laws decide
  the witness is produced on either hand
  for this, or that, the partial people stand
  the appointed heralds still the noisy bands,
  and form a ring, with sceptres in their hands
  on seats of stone, within the sacred place,
  the reverend elders nodded o'er the case
  alternate, each the attesting sceptre took,
  and rising solemn, each his sentence spoke
  two golden talents lay amidst, in sight,
  the prize of him who best adjudged the right.
  another part  a prospect differing far
  glow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war.
  two mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace,
  and one would pillage, one would burn the place.
  meantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care,
  a secret ambush on the foe prepare
  their wives, their children, and the watchful band
  of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.
  they march  by pallas and by mars made bold
  gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,
  and gold their armour  these the squadron led,
  august, divine, superior by the head!
  a place for ambush fit they found, and stood,
  cover'd with shields, beside a silver flood.
  two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem
  if sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.
  soon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains,
  and steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains
  behind them piping on their reeds they go,
  nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.
  in arms the glittering squadron rising round
  rush sudden  hills of slaughter heap the ground
  whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,
  and, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!
  the bellowing oxen the besiegers hear
  they rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,
  they fight, they fall, beside the silver flood
  the waving silver seem'd to blush with blood.
  there tumult, there contention stood confess'd
  one rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast
  one held a living foe, that freshly bled
  with new-made wounds  another dragg'd a dead
  now here, now there, the carcases they tore
  fate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.
  and the whole war came out, and met the eye
  and each bold figure seem'd to live or die.
  a field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,
  the third time labour'd by the sweating hind
  the shining shares full many ploughmen guide,
  and turn their crooked yokes on every side.
  still as at either end they wheel around,
  the master meets them with his goblet crown'd
  the hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,
  then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil
  behind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd
  and sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.
  another field rose high with waving grain
  with bended sickles stand the reaper train
  here stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,
  sheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.
  with sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands
  the gatherers follow, and collect in bands
  and last the children, in whose arms are borne
   too short to gripe them  the brown sheaves of corn.
  the rustic monarch of the field descries,
  with silent glee, the heaps around him rise.
  a ready banquet on the turf is laid,
  beneath an ample oak's expanded shade.
  the victim ox the sturdy youth prepare
  the reaper's due repast, the woman's care.
  next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,
  bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines
  a deeper dye the dangling clusters show,
  and curl'd on silver props, in order glow
  a darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place
  and pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.
  to this, one pathway gently winding leads,
  where march a train with baskets on their heads,
   fair maids and blooming youths,  that smiling bear
  the purple product of the autumnal year.
  to these a youth awakes the warbling strings,
  whose tender lay the fate of linus sings
  in measured dance behind him move the train,
  tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.
  here herds of oxen march, erect and bold,
  rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,
  and speed to meadows on whose sounding shores
  a rapid torrent through the rushes roars
  four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,
  and nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.
  two lions rushing from the wood appear'd
  and seized a bull, the master of the herd
  he roar'd  in vain the dogs, the men withstood
  they tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.
  the dogs  oft cheer'd in vain  desert the prey,
  dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.
  next this, the eye the art of vulcan leads
  deep through fair forests, and a length of meads,
  and stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between
  and fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.
  a figured dance succeeds  such once was seen
  in lofty gnossus for the cretan queen,
  form'd by daedalean art  a comely band
  of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.
  the maids in soft simars of linen dress'd
  the youths all graceful in the glossy vest
  of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd
  of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,
  that glittering gay, from silver belts depend.
  now all at once they rise, at once descend,
  with well-taught feet  now shape in oblique ways,
  confusedly regular, the moving maze
  now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,
  and undistinguish'd blend the flying ring
  so whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,
  and, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.
  the gazing multitudes admire around
  two active tumblers in the centre bound
  now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend
  and general songs the sprightly revel end.
  thus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd
  with his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round
  in living silver seem'd the waves to roll,
  and beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.
  this done, whate'er a warrior's use requires
  he forged  the cuirass that outshone the fires,
  the greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd
  with various sculpture, and the golden crest.
  at thetis' feet the finished labour lay
  she, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,
  swift from olympus' snowy summit flies,
  and bears the blazing present through the skies.
book xix.
argument.
the reconciliation of achilles and agamemnon.
thetis brings to her son the armour made by vulcan. she preserves the body
of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the army, to
declare his resentment at an end. agamemnon and achilles are solemnly
reconciled  the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that occasion.
achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle
till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of ulysses. the
presents are conveyed to the tent of achilles, where briseis laments over
the body of patroclus. the hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives
himself up to lamentations for his friend. minerva descends to strengthen
him, by the order of jupiter. he arms for the fight  his appearance
described. he addresses himself to his horses, and reproaches them with
the death of patroclus. one of them is miraculously endued with voice, and
inspired to prophesy his fate  but the hero, not astonished by that
prodigy, rushes with fury to the combat.
the thirteenth day. the scene is on the sea-shore.
  soon as aurora heaved her orient head
  above the waves, that blush'd with early red,
   with new-born day to gladden mortal sight,
  and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,
  the immortal arms the goddess-mother bears
  swift to her son  her son she finds in tears
  stretch'd o'er patroclus' corse  while all the rest
  their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.
  a ray divine her heavenly presence shed,
  and thus, his hand soft touching, thetis said
   suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know
  it was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow
  behold what arms by vulcan are bestow'd,
  arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god.
  then drops the radiant burden on the ground
  clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around
  back shrink the myrmidons with dread surprise,
  and from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.
  unmoved the hero kindles at the show,
  and feels with rage divine his bosom glow
  from his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,
  and flash incessant like a stream of fire
  he turns the radiant gift  and feeds his mind
  on all the immortal artist had design'd.
   goddess!  he cried,  these glorious arms, that shine
  with matchless art, confess the hand divine.
  now to the bloody battle let me bend
  but ah! the relics of my slaughter'd friend!
  in those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,
  shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?
   that unavailing care be laid aside,
   the azure goddess to her son replied,
  whole years untouch'd, uninjured shall remain,
  fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.
  but go, achilles, as affairs require,
  before the grecian peers renounce thine ire
  then uncontroll'd in boundless war engage,
  and heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!
  then in the nostrils of the slain she pour'd
  nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower'd
  o'er all the corse. the flies forbid their prey,
  untouch'd it rests, and sacred from decay.
  achilles to the strand obedient went
  the shores resounded with the voice he sent.
  the heroes heard, and all the naval train
  that tend the ships, or guide them o'er the main,
  alarm'd, transported, at the well-known sound,
  frequent and full, the great assembly crown'd
  studious to see the terror of the plain,
  long lost to battle, shine in arms again.
  tydides and ulysses first appear,
  lame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear
  these on the sacred seats of council placed,
  the king of men, atrides, came the last
  he too sore wounded by agenor's son.
  achilles  rising in the midst  begun
   o monarch! better far had been the fate
  of thee, of me, of all the grecian state,
  if  ere the day when by mad passion sway'd,
  rash we contended for the black-eyed maid
  preventing dian had despatch'd her dart,
  and shot the shining mischief to the heart!
  then many a hero had not press'd the shore,
  nor troy's glad fields been fatten'd with our gore.
  long, long shall greece the woes we caused bewail,
  and sad posterity repeat the tale.
  but this, no more the subject of debate,
  is past, forgotten, and resign'd to fate.
  why should, alas, a mortal man, as i,
  burn with a fury that can never die?
  here then my anger ends  let war succeed,
  and even as greece has bled, let ilion bleed.
  now call the hosts, and try if in our sight
  troy yet shall dare to camp a second night!
  i deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows,
  shall 'scape with transport, and with joy repose.
  he said  his finish'd wrath with loud acclaim
  the greeks accept, and shout pelides' name.
  when thus, not rising from his lofty throne,
  in state unmoved, the king of men begun
   hear me, ye sons of greece! with silence hear!
  and grant your monarch an impartial ear
  awhile your loud, untimely joy suspend,
  and let your rash, injurious clamours end
  unruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause,
  wrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.
  nor charge on me, ye greeks, the dire debate
  know, angry jove, and all-compelling fate,
  with fell erinnys, urged my wrath that day
  when from achilles' arms i forced the prey.
  what then could i against the will of heaven?
  not by myself, but vengeful ate driven
  she, jove's dread daughter, fated to infest
  the race of mortals, enter'd in my breast.
  not on the ground that haughty fury treads,
  but prints her lofty footsteps on the heads
  of mighty men  inflicting as she goes
  long-festering wounds, inextricable woes!
  of old, she stalk'd amid the bright abodes
  and jove himself, the sire of men and gods,
  the world's great ruler, felt her venom'd dart
  deceived by juno's wiles, and female art
  for when alcmena's nine long months were run,
  and jove expected his immortal son,
  to gods and goddesses the unruly joy
  he show'd, and vaunted of his matchless boy
  'from us,  he said  this day an infant springs,
  fated to rule, and born a king of kings.'
  saturnia ask'd an oath, to vouch the truth,
  and fix dominion on the favour'd youth.
  the thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,
  pronounced those solemn words that bind a god.
  the joyful goddess, from olympus' height,
  swift to achaian argos bent her flight
  scarce seven moons gone, lay sthenelus's wife
  she push'd her lingering infant into life
  her charms alcmena's coming labours stay,
  and stop the babe, just issuing to the day.
  then bids saturnius bear his oath in mind
  'a youth  said she  of jove's immortal kind
  is this day born  from sthenelus he springs,
  and claims thy promise to be king of kings.'
  grief seized the thunderer, by his oath engaged
  stung to the soul, he sorrow'd, and he raged.
  from his ambrosial head, where perch'd she sate,
  he snatch'd the fury-goddess of debate,
  the dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,
  the immortal seats should ne'er behold her more
  and whirl'd her headlong down, for ever driven
  from bright olympus and the starry heaven
  thence on the nether world the fury fell
  ordain'd with man's contentious race to dwell.
  full oft the god his son's hard toils bemoan'd,
  cursed the dire fury, and in secret groan'd.
  even thus, like jove himself, was i misled,
  while raging hector heap'd our camps with dead.
  what can the errors of my rage atone?
  my martial troops, my treasures are thy own
  this instant from the navy shall be sent
  whate'er ulysses promised at thy tent
  but thou! appeased, propitious to our prayer,
  resume thy arms, and shine again in war.
    o king of nations! whose superior sway
   returns achilles  all our hosts obey!
  to keep or send the presents, be thy care
  to us, 'tis equal  all we ask is war.
  while yet we talk, or but an instant shun
  the fight, our glorious work remains undone.
  let every greek, who sees my spear confound
  the trojan ranks, and deal destruction round,
  with emulation, what i act survey,
  and learn from thence the business of the day.
  the son of peleus thus  and thus replies
  the great in councils, ithacus the wise
   though, godlike, thou art by no toils oppress'd,
  at least our armies claim repast and rest
  long and laborious must the combat be,
  when by the gods inspired, and led by thee.
  strength is derived from spirits and from blood,
  and those augment by generous wine and food
  what boastful son of war, without that stay,
  can last a hero through a single day?
  courage may prompt  but, ebbing out his strength,
  mere unsupported man must yield at length
  shrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,
  the drooping body will desert the mind
  but built anew with strength-conferring fare,
  with limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.
  dismiss the people, then, and give command.
  with strong repast to hearten every band
  but let the presents to achilles made,
  in full assembly of all greece be laid.
  the king of men shall rise in public sight,
  and solemn swear  observant of the rite
  that, spotless, as she came, the maid removes,
  pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.
  that done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made,
  and the full price of injured honour paid.
  stretch not henceforth, o prince.! thy sovereign might
  beyond the bounds of reason and of right
  'tis the chief praise that e'er to kings belong'd,
  to right with justice whom with power they wrong'd.
  to him the monarch   just is thy decree,
  thy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee.
  each due atonement gladly i prepare
  and heaven regard me as i justly swear!
  here then awhile let greece assembled stay,
  nor great achilles grudge this short delay.
  till from the fleet our presents be convey'd,
  and jove attesting, the firm compact made.
  a train of noble youths the charge shall bear
  these to select, ulysses, be thy care
  in order rank'd let all our gifts appear,
  and the fair train of captives close the rear
  talthybius shall the victim boar convey,
  sacred to jove, and yon bright orb of day.
   for this  the stern  acides replies
  some less important season may suffice,
  when the stern fury of the war is o'er,
  and wrath, extinguish'd, burns my breast no more.
  by hector slain, their faces to the sky,
  all grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie
  those call to war! and might my voice incite,
  now, now, this instant, shall commence the fight
  then, when the day's complete, let generous bowls,
  and copious banquets, glad your weary souls.
  let not my palate know the taste of food,
  till my insatiate rage be cloy'd with blood
  pale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o'er,
  and his cold feet are pointed to the door.
  revenge is all my soul! no meaner care,
  interest, or thought, has room to harbour there
  destruction be my feast, and mortal wounds,
  and scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds.
   o first of greeks,  ulysses thus rejoin'd,
  the best and bravest of the warrior kind!
  thy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine,
  but old experience and calm wisdom mine.
  then hear my counsel, and to reason yield,
  the bravest soon are satiate of the field
  though vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain,
  the bloody harvest brings but little gain
  the scale of conquest ever wavering lies,
  great jove but turns it, and the victor dies!
  the great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,
  and endless were the grief, to weep for all.
  eternal sorrows what avails to shed?
  greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead
  enough, when death demands the brave, to pay
  the tribute of a melancholy day.
  one chief with patience to the grave resign'd,
  our care devolves on others left behind.
  let generous food supplies of strength produce,
  let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice,
  let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow,
  and pour new furies on the feebler foe.
  yet a short interval, and none shall dare
  expect a second summons to the war
  who waits for that, the dire effects shall find,
  if trembling in the ships he lags behind.
  embodied, to the battle let us bend,
  and all at once on haughty troy descend.
  and now the delegates ulysses sent,
  to bear the presents from the royal tent
  the sons of nestor, phyleus' valiant heir,
  thias and merion, thunderbolts of war,
  with lycomedes of creiontian strain,
  and melanippus, form'd the chosen train.
  swift as the word was given, the youths obey'd
  twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid
  a row of six fair tripods then succeeds
  and twice the number of high-bounding steeds
  seven captives next a lovely line compose
  the eighth briseis, like the blooming rose,
  closed the bright band  great ithacus, before,
  first of the train, the golden talents bore
  the rest in public view the chiefs dispose,
  a splendid scene! then agamemnon rose
  the boar talthybius held  the grecian lord
  drew the broad cutlass sheath'd beside his sword
  the stubborn bristles from the victim's brow
  he crops, and offering meditates his vow.
  his hands uplifted to the attesting skies,
  on heaven's broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.
  the solemn words a deep attention draw,
  and greece around sat thrill'd with sacred awe.
   witness thou first! thou greatest power above,
  all-good, all-wise, and all-surveying jove!
  and mother-earth, and heaven's revolving light,
  and ye, fell furies of the realms of night,
  who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare
  for perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!
  the black-eyed maid inviolate removes,
  pure and unconscious of my manly loves.
  if this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,
  and levell'd thunder strike my guilty head!
  with that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound
  the bleeding savage tumbles to the ground
  the sacred herald rolls the victim slain
   a feast for fish  into the foaming main.
  then thus achilles   hear, ye greeks! and know
  whate'er we feel, 'tis jove inflicts the woe
  not else atrides could our rage inflame,
  nor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.
  'twas jove's high will alone, o'erruling all,
  that doom'd our strife, and doom'd the greeks to fall.
  go then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite
  achilles waits ye, and expects the fight.
  the speedy council at his word adjourn'd
  to their black vessels all the greeks return'd.
  achilles sought his tent. his train before
  march'd onward, bending with the gifts they bore.
  those in the tents the squires industrious spread
  the foaming coursers to the stalls they led
  to their new seats the female captives move
  briseis, radiant as the queen of love,
  slow as she pass'd, beheld with sad survey
  where, gash'd with cruel wounds, patroclus lay.
  prone on the body fell the heavenly fair,
  beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair
  all beautiful in grief, her humid eyes
  shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries
   ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,
  once tender friend of my distracted mind!
  i left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay
  now find thee cold, inanimated clay!
  what woes my wretched race of life attend!
  sorrows on sorrows, never doom'd to end!
  the first loved consort of my virgin bed
  before these eyes in fatal battle bled
  my three brave brothers in one mournful day
  all trod the dark, irremeable way
  thy friendly hand uprear'd me from the plain,
  and dried my sorrows for a husband slain
  achilles' care you promised i should prove,
  the first, the dearest partner of his love
  that rites divine should ratify the band,
  and make me empress in his native land.
  accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,
  for thee, that ever felt another's woe!
  her sister captives echoed groan for groan,
  nor mourn'd patroclus' fortunes, but their own.
  the leaders press'd the chief on every side
  unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.
   if yet achilles have a friend, whose care
  is bent to please him, this request forbear
  till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay
  to grief and anguish one abstemious day.
  he spoke, and from the warriors turn'd his face
  yet still the brother-kings of atreus' race,
  nestor, idomeneus, ulysses sage,
  and phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage
  his rage they calm not, nor his grief control
  he groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.
   thou too, patroclus!  thus his heart he vents
  once spread the inviting banquet in our tents
  thy sweet society, thy winning care,
  once stay'd achilles, rushing to the war.
  but now, alas! to death's cold arms resign'd,
  what banquet but revenge can glad my mind?
  what greater sorrow could afflict my breast,
  what more if hoary peleus were deceased?
  who now, perhaps, in phthia dreads to hear
  his son's sad fate, and drops a tender tear.
  what more, should neoptolemus the brave,
  my only offspring, sink into the grave?
  if yet that offspring lives   i distant far,
  of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.
  i could not this, this cruel stroke attend
  fate claim'd achilles, but might spare his friend.
  i hoped patroclus might survive, to rear
  my tender orphan with a parent's care,
  from scyros' isle conduct him o'er the main,
  and glad his eyes with his paternal reign,
  the lofty palace, and the large domain.
  for peleus breathes no more the vital air
  or drags a wretched life of age and care,
  but till the news of my sad fate invades
  his hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades.
  sighing he said  his grief the heroes join'd,
  each stole a tear for what he left behind.
  their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey'd,
  and thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid
   is then achilles now no more thy care,
  and dost thou thus desert the great in war?
  lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,
  all comfortless he sits, and wails his friend
  ere thirst and want his forces have oppress'd,
  haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast.
  he spoke  and sudden, at the word of jove,
  shot the descending goddess from above.
  so swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,
  the wide air floating to her ample wings,
  to great achilles she her flight address'd,
  and pour'd divine ambrosia in his breast,
  with nectar sweet,  refection of the gods!
  then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.
  now issued from the ships the warrior-train,
  and like a deluge pour'd upon the plain.
  as when the piercing blasts of boreas blow,
  and scatter o'er the fields the driving snow
  from dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,
  whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies
  so helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,
  catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields
  broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,
  mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze
  thick beats the centre as the coursers bound
  with splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,
  full in the midst, high-towering o'er the rest,
  his limbs in arms divine achilles dress'd
  arms which the father of the fire bestow'd,
  forged on the eternal anvils of the god.
  grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,
  his glowing eyeballs roll with living fire
  he grinds his teeth, and furious with delay
  o'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.
  the silver cuishes first his thighs infold
  then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold
  the brazen sword a various baldric tied,
  that, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side
  and, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield
  blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.
  so to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,
  wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,
  which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,
  streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky
  with mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again
  loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.
  next, his high head the helmet graced  behind
  the sweepy crest hung floating in the wind
  like the red star, that from his flaming hair
  shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war
  so stream'd the golden honours from his head,
  trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.
  the chief beholds himself with wondering eyes
  his arms he poises, and his motions tries
  buoy'd by some inward force, he seems to swim,
  and feels a pinion lifting every limb.
  and now he shakes his great paternal spear,
  ponderous and huge, which not a greek could rear,
  from pelion's cloudy top an ash entire
  old chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his sire
  a spear which stern achilles only wields,
  the death of heroes, and the dread of fields.
  automedon and alcimus prepare
  the immortal coursers, and the radiant car
   the silver traces sweeping at their side
  their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied
  the ivory-studded reins, return'd behind,
  waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.
  the charioteer then whirl'd the lash around,
  and swift ascended at one active bound.
  all bright in heavenly arms, above his squire
  achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire
  not brighter phoebus in the ethereal way
  flames from his chariot, and restores the day.
  high o'er the host, all terrible he stands,
  and thunders to his steeds these dread commands
   xanthus and balius! of podarges' strain,
   unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,
  be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,
  and learn to make your master more your care
  through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,
  nor, as ye left patroclus, leave your lord.
  the generous xanthus, as the words he said,
  seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head
  trembling he stood before the golden wain,
  and bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.
  when, strange to tell!  so juno will'd  he broke
  eternal silence, and portentous spoke.
   achilles! yes! this day at least we bear
  thy rage in safety through the files of war
  but come it will, the fatal time must come,
  not ours the fault, but god decrees thy doom.
  not through our crime, or slowness in the course,
  fell thy patroclus, but by heavenly force
  the bright far-shooting god who gilds the day
   confess'd we saw him  tore his arms way.
  no--could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,
  or beat the pinions of the western gale,
  all were in vain--the fates thy death demand,
  due to a mortal and immortal hand.
  then ceased for ever, by the furies tied,
  his fateful voice. the intrepid chief replied
  with unabated rage-- so let it be!
  portents and prodigies are lost on me.
  i know my fate  to die, to see no more
  my much-loved parents, and my native shore--
  enough--when heaven ordains, i sink in night
  now perish troy!  he said, and rush'd to fight.
  thus round pelides breathing war and blood
  greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood
  while near impending from a neighbouring height,
  troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight.
  then jove to themis gives command, to call
  the gods to council in the starry hall
  swift o'er olympus' hundred hills she flies,
  and summons all the senate of the skies.
  these shining on, in long procession come
  to jove's eternal adamantine dome.
  not one was absent, not a rural power
  that haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower
  each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood,
  each azure sister of the silver flood
  all but old ocean, hoary sire! who keeps
  his ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.
  on marble thrones, with lucid columns crown'd,
   the work of vulcan,  sat the powers around.
  even he whose trident sways the watery reign
  heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,
  assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,
  and question'd thus the sire of men and gods
   what moves the god who heaven and earth commands,
  and grasps the thunder in his awful hands,
  thus to convene the whole ethereal state?
  is greece and troy the subject in debate?
  already met, the louring hosts appear,
  and death stands ardent on the edge of war.
   'tis true  the cloud-compelling power replies
  this day we call the council of the skies
  in care of human race  even jove's own eye
  sees with regret unhappy mortals die.
  far on olympus' top in secret state
  ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate
  work out our will. celestial powers! descend,
  and as your minds direct, your succour lend
  to either host. troy soon must lie o'erthrown,
  if uncontroll'd achilles fights alone
  their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes
  what can they now, if in his rage he rise?
  assist them, gods! or ilion's sacred wall
  may fall this day, though fate forbids the fall.
  he said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.
  on adverse parts the warring gods engage
  heaven's awful queen  and he whose azure round
  girds the vast globe  the maid in arms renown'd
  hermes, of profitable arts the sire
  and vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire
  these to the fleet repair with instant flight
  the vessels tremble as the gods alight.
  in aid of troy, latona, phoebus came,
  mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame,
  xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,
  and the chaste huntress of the silver bow.
  ere yet the gods their various aid employ,
  each argive bosom swell'd with manly joy,
  while great achilles  terror of the plain ,
  long lost to battle, shone in arms again.
  dreadful he stood in front of all his host
  pale troy beheld, and seem'd already lost
  her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,
  and trembling see another god of war.
  but when the powers descending swell'd the fight,
  then tumult rose  fierce rage and pale affright
  varied each face  then discord sounds alarms,
  earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.
  now through the trembling shores minerva calls,
  and now she thunders from the grecian walls.
  mars hovering o'er his troy, his terror shrouds
  in gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds
  now through each trojan heart he fury pours
  with voice divine, from ilion's topmost towers
  now shouts to simois, from her beauteous hill
  the mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.
  above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,
  and peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.
  beneath, stern neptune shakes the solid ground
  the forests wave, the mountains nod around
  through all their summits tremble ida's woods,
  and from their sources boil her hundred floods.
  troy's turrets totter on the rocking plain,
  and the toss'd navies beat the heaving main.
  deep in the dismal regions of the dead,
  the infernal monarch rear'd his horrid head,
  leap'd from his throne, lest neptune's arm should lay
  his dark dominions open to the day,
  and pour in light on pluto's drear abodes,
  abhorr'd by men, and dreadful even to gods.
  such war the immortals wage  such horrors rend
  the world's vast concave, when the gods contend
  first silver-shafted phoebus took the plain
  against blue neptune, monarch of the main.
  the god of arms his giant bulk display'd,
  opposed to pallas, war's triumphant maid.
  against latona march'd the son of may.
  the quiver'd dian, sister of the day,
   her golden arrows sounding at her side,
  saturnia, majesty of heaven, defied.
  with fiery vulcan last in battle stands
  the sacred flood that rolls on golden sands
  xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth,
  but called scamander by the sons of earth.
  while thus the gods in various league engage,
  achilles glow'd with more than mortal rage
  hector he sought  in search of hector turn'd
  his eyes around, for hector only burn'd
  and burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow'd
  to glut the god of battles with his blood.
   neas was the first who dared to stay
  apollo wedged him in the warrior's way,
  but swell'd his bosom with undaunted might,
  half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.
  like young lycaon, of the royal line,
  in voice and aspect, seem'd the power divine
  and bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn
  in distant threats he braved the goddess-born.
  then thus the hero of anchises' strain
   to meet pelides you persuade in vain
  already have i met, nor void of fear
  observed the fury of his flying spear
  from ida's woods he chased us to the field,
  our force he scattered, and our herds he kill'd
  lyrnessus, pedasus in ashes lay
  but  jove assisting  i survived the day
  else had i sunk oppress'd in fatal fight
  by fierce achilles and minerva's might.
  where'er he moved, the goddess shone before,
  and bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.
  what mortal man achilles can sustain?
  the immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,
  and suffer not his dart to fall in vain.
  were god my aid, this arm should check his power,
  though strong in battle as a brazen tower.
  to whom the son of jove   that god implore,
  and be what great achilles was before.
  from heavenly venus thou deriv'st thy strain,
  and he but from a sister of the main
  an aged sea-god father of his line
  but jove himself the sacred source of thine.
  then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,
  nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe.
  this said, and spirit breathed into his breast,
  through the thick troops the embolden'd hero press'd
  his venturous act the white-arm'd queen survey'd,
  and thus, assembling all the powers, she said
   behold an action, gods! that claims your care,
  lo great  neas rushing to the war!
  against pelides he directs his course,
  phoebus impels, and phoebus gives him force.
  restrain his bold career  at least, to attend
  our favour'd hero, let some power descend.
  to guard his life, and add to his renown,
  we, the great armament of heaven, came down.
  hereafter let him fall, as fates design,
  that spun so short his life's illustrious line
  but lest some adverse god now cross his way,
  give him to know what powers assist this day
  for how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,
  when heaven's refulgent host appear in arms?
  thus she  and thus the god whose force can make
  the solid globe's eternal basis shake
   against the might of man, so feeble known,
  why should celestial powers exert their own?
  suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,
  and leave to war the fates of mortal men.
  but if the armipotent, or god of light,
  obstruct achilles, or commence the fight.
  thence on the gods of troy we swift descend
  full soon, i doubt not, shall the conflict end
  and these, in ruin and confusion hurl'd,
  yield to our conquering arms the lower world.
  thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,
  coerulean neptune, rose, and led the way.
  advanced upon the field there stood a mound
  of earth congested, wall'd, and trench'd around
  in elder times to guard alcides made,
   the work of trojans, with minerva's aid,
  what time a vengeful monster of the main
  swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.
  here neptune and the gods of greece repair,
  with clouds encompass'd, and a veil of air
  the adverse powers, around apollo laid,
  crown the fair hills that silver simois shade.
  in circle close each heavenly party sat,
  intent to form the future scheme of fate
  but mix not yet in fight, though jove on high
  gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.
  meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground
  the trampled centre yields a hollow sound
  steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,
  the gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.
  amid both hosts  a dreadful space  appear,
  there great achilles  bold  neas, here.
  with towering strides aeneas first advanced
  the nodding plumage on his helmet danced
  spread o'er his breast the fencing shield he bore,
  and, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.
  not so pelides  furious to engage,
  he rush'd impetuous. such the lion's rage,
  who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,
  though all in arms the peopled city rise,
  stalks careless on, with unregarding pride
  till at the length, by some brave youth defied,
  to his bold spear the savage turns alone,
  he murmurs fury with a hollow groan
  he grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around
  lash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound
  he calls up all his rage  he grinds his teeth,
  resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.
  so fierce achilles on  neas flies
  so stands  neas, and his force defies.
  ere yet the stern encounter join'd, begun
  the seed of thetis thus to venus' son
   why comes  neas through the ranks so far?
  seeks he to meet achilles' arm in war,
  in hope the realms of priam to enjoy,
  and prove his merits to the throne of troy?
  grant that beneath thy lance achilles dies,
  the partial monarch may refuse the prize
  sons he has many  those thy pride may quell
  and 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,
  or, in reward of thy victorious hand,
  has troy proposed some spacious tract of land
  an ample forest, or a fair domain,
  of hills for vines, and arable for grain?
  even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.
  but can achilles be so soon forgot?
  once  as i think  you saw this brandish'd spear
  and then the great  neas seem'd to fear
  with hearty haste from ida's mount he fled,
  nor, till he reach'd lyrnessus, turn'd his head.
  her lofty walls not long our progress stay'd
  those, pallas, jove, and we, in ruins laid
  in grecian chains her captive race were cast
  'tis true, the great aeneas fled too fast.
  defrauded of my conquest once before,
  what then i lost, the gods this day restore.
  go  while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate
  fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.
  to this anchises' son   such words employ
  to one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy
  such we disdain  the best may be defied
  with mean reproaches, and unmanly pride
  unworthy the high race from which we came
  proclaim'd so loudly by the voice of fame
  each from illustrious fathers draws his line
  each goddess-born  half human, half divine.
  thetis' this day, or venus' offspring dies,
  and tears shall trickle from celestial eyes
  for when two heroes, thus derived, contend,
  'tis not in words the glorious strife can end.
  if yet thou further seek to learn my birth
   a tale resounded through the spacious earth
  hear how the glorious origin we prove
  from ancient dardanus, the first from jove
  dardania's walls he raised  for ilion, then,
   the city since of many-languaged men,
  was not. the natives were content to till
  the shady foot of ida's fountful hill.
  from dardanus great erichthonius springs,
  the richest, once, of asia's wealthy kings
  three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,
  three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.
  boreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,
  conceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,
  with voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,
  and coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead
  hence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,
  swift as their mother mares, and father wind.
  these lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,
  nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain
  and when along the level seas they flew,
  scarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.
  such erichthonius was  from him there came
  the sacred tros, of whom the trojan name.
  three sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,
  ilus, assaracus, and ganymed
  the matchless ganymed, divinely fair,
  whom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,
  to bear the cup of jove  ethereal guest,
  the grace and glory of the ambrosial feast .
  the two remaining sons the line divide
  first rose laomedon from ilus' side
  from him tithonus, now in cares grown old,
  and priam, bless'd with hector, brave and bold
  clytius and lampus, ever-honour'd pair
  and hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.
  from great assaracus sprang capys, he
  begat anchises, and anchises me.
  such is our race  'tis fortune gives us birth,
  but jove alone endues the soul with worth
  he, source of power and might! with boundless sway,
  all human courage gives, or takes away.
  long in the field of words we may contend,
  reproach is infinite, and knows no end,
  arm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong
  so voluble a weapon is the tongue
  wounded, we wound  and neither side can fail,
  for every man has equal strength to rail
  women alone, when in the streets they jar,
  perhaps excel us in this wordy war
  like us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,
  and vent their anger impotent and loud.
  cease then--our business in the field of fight
  is not to question, but to prove our might.
  to all those insults thou hast offer'd here,
  receive this answer  'tis my flying spear.
  he spoke. with all his force the javelin flung,
  fix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.
  far on his outstretch'd arm, pelides held
   to meet the thundering lance  his dreadful shield,
  that trembled as it stuck  nor void of fear
  saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.
  his fears were vain  impenetrable charms
  secured the temper of the ethereal arms.
  through two strong plates the point its passage held,
  but stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.
  five plates of various metal, various mould,
  composed the shield  of brass each outward fold,
  of tin each inward, and the middle gold
  there stuck the lance. then rising ere he threw,
  the forceful spear of great achilles flew,
  and pierced the dardan shield's extremest bound,
  where the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound
  through the thin verge the pelean weapon glides,
  and the slight covering of expanded hides.
   neas his contracted body bends,
  and o'er him high the riven targe extends,
  sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,
  and at his back perceives the quivering spear
  a fate so near him, chills his soul with fright
  and swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.
  achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,
  draws his broad blade, and at  neas flies
   neas rousing as the foe came on,
  with force collected, heaves a mighty stone
  a mass enormous! which in modern days
  no two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.
  but ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground.
  saw the distress, and moved the powers around
   lo! on the brink of fate  neas stands,
  an instant victim to achilles' hands
  by phoebus urged  but phoebus has bestow'd
  his aid in vain  the man o'erpowers the god.
  and can ye see this righteous chief atone
  with guiltless blood for vices not his own?
  to all the gods his constant vows were paid
  sure, though he wars for troy, he claims our aid.
  fate wills not this  nor thus can jove resign
  the future father of the dardan line
  the first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,
  and still his love descends on all the race
  for priam now, and priam's faithless kind,
  at length are odious to the all-seeing mind
  on great  neas shall devolve the reign,
  and sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.
  the great earth-shaker thus  to whom replies
  the imperial goddess with the radiant eyes
   good as he is, to immolate or spare
  the dardan prince, o neptune! be thy care
  pallas and i, by all that gods can bind,
  have sworn destruction to the trojan kind
  not even an instant to protract their fate,
  or save one member of the sinking state
  till her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,
  and even her crumbling ruins are no more.
  the king of ocean to the fight descends,
  through all the whistling darts his course he bends,
  swift interposed between the warrior flies,
  and casts thick darkness o'er achilles' eyes.
  from great  neas' shield the spear he drew,
  and at his master's feet the weapon threw.
  that done, with force divine he snatch'd on high
  the dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,
  smooth-gliding without step, above the heads
  of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds
  till at the battle's utmost verge they light,
  where the slow caucans close the rear of fight.
  the godhead there  his heavenly form confess'd
  with words like these the panting chief address'd
   what power, o prince! with force inferior far,
  urged thee to meet achilles' arm in war?
  henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,
  defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.
  but when the day decreed  for come it must
  shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,
  let then the furies of that arm be known,
  secure no grecian force transcends thy own.
  with that, he left him wondering as he lay,
  then from achilles chased the mist away
  sudden, returning with a stream of light,
  the scene of war came rushing on his sight.
  then thus, amazed   what wonders strike my mind!
  my spear, that parted on the wings of wind,
  laid here before me! and the dardan lord,
  that fell this instant, vanish'd from my sword!
  i thought alone with mortals to contend,
  but powers celestial sure this foe defend.
  great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,
  content for once, with all his gods, to fly.
  now then let others bleed.  this said, aloud
  he vents his fury and inflames the crowd
   o greeks!  he cries, and every rank alarms
  join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!
  'tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,
  to mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly
  no god can singly such a host engage,
  not mars himself, nor great minerva's rage.
  but whatsoe'er achilles can inspire,
  whate'er of active force, or acting fire
  whate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey
  all, all achilles, greeks! is yours to-day.
  through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,
  and thin the squadrons with my single spear.
  he said  nor less elate with martial joy,
  the godlike hector warm'd the troops of troy
   trojans, to war! think, hector leads you on
  nor dread the vaunts of peleus' haughty son.
  deeds must decide our fate. e'en these with words
  insult the brave, who tremble at their swords
  the weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,
  but shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.
  nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,
  not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire
  that fire, that steel, your hector should withstand,
  and brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.
  thus  breathing rage through all  the hero said
  a wood of lances rises round his head,
  clamours on clamours tempest all the air,
  they join, they throng, they thicken to the war.
  but phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun
  the single fight with thetis' godlike son
  more safe to combat in the mingled band,
  nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.
  he hears, obedient to the god of light,
  and, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.
  then fierce achilles, shouting to the skies,
  on troy's whole force with boundless fury flies.
  first falls iphytion, at his army's head
  brave was the chief, and brave the host he led
  from great otrynteus he derived his blood,
  his mother was a nais, of the flood
  beneath the shades of tmolus, crown'd with snow,
  from hyde's walls he ruled the lands below.
  fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides
  the parted visage falls on equal sides
  with loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain
  while thus achilles glories o'er the slain
   lie there, otryntides! the trojan earth
  receives thee dead, though gygae boast thy birth
  those beauteous fields where hyllus' waves are roll'd,
  and plenteous hermus swells with tides of gold,
  are thine no more. --the insulting hero said,
  and left him sleeping in eternal shade.
  the rolling wheels of greece the body tore,
  and dash'd their axles with no vulgar gore.
  demoleon next, antenor's offspring, laid
  breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.
  the impatient steel with full-descending sway
  forced through his brazen helm its furious way,
  resistless drove the batter'd skull before,
  and dash'd and mingled all the brains with gore.
  this sees hippodamas, and seized with fright,
  deserts his chariot for a swifter flight
  the lance arrests him  an ignoble wound
  the panting trojan rivets to the ground.
  he groans away his soul  not louder roars,
  at neptune's shrine on helice's high shores,
  the victim bull  the rocks re-bellow round,
  and ocean listens to the grateful sound.
  then fell on polydore his vengeful rage,
  the youngest hope of priam's stooping age
   whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass'd
  of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.
  to the forbidden field he takes his flight,
  in the first folly of a youthful knight,
  to vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,
  but vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain
  struck where the crossing belts unite behind,
  and golden rings the double back-plate join'd
  forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel
  and on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell
  the rushing entrails pour'd upon the ground
  his hands collect  and darkness wraps him round.
  when hector view'd, all ghastly in his gore,
  thus sadly slain the unhappy polydore,
  a cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,
  his soul no longer brook'd the distant fight
  full in achilles' dreadful front he came,
  and shook his javelin like a waving flame.
  the son of peleus sees, with joy possess'd,
  his heart high-bounding in his rising breast.
   and, lo! the man on whom black fates attend
  the man, that slew achilles, is his friend!
  no more shall hector's and pelides' spear
  turn from each other in the walks of war. --
  then with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er
   come, and receive thy fate!  he spake no more.
  hector, undaunted, thus   such words employ
  to one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy
  such we could give, defying and defied,
  mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!
  i know thy force to mine superior far
  but heaven alone confers success in war
  mean as i am, the gods may guide my dart,
  and give it entrance in a braver heart.
  then parts the lance  but pallas' heavenly breath
  far from achilles wafts the winged death
  the bidden dart again to hector flies,
  and at the feet of its great master lies.
  achilles closes with his hated foe,
  his heart and eyes with flaming fury glow
  but present to his aid, apollo shrouds
  the favour'd hero in a veil of clouds.
  thrice struck pelides with indignant heart,
  thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart
  the spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.
  he foams with fury, and exclaims aloud
   wretch! thou hast 'scaped again  once more thy flight
  has saved thee, and the partial god of light.
  but long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,
  if any power assist achilles' hand.
  fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day
  whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay.
  with that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain
  then dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,
  pierced through the neck  he left him panting there,
  and stopp'd demuchus, great philetor's heir.
  gigantic chief! deep gash'd the enormous blade,
  and for the soul an ample passage made.
  laoganus and dardanus expire,
  the valiant sons of an unhappy sire
  both in one instant from the chariot hurl'd,
  sunk in one instant to the nether world
  this difference only their sad fates afford
  that one the spear destroy'd, and one the sword.
  nor less unpitied, young alastor bleeds
  in vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads
  in vain he begs thee, with a suppliant's moan,
  to spare a form, an age so like thy own!
  unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,
  e'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!
  while yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,
  the ruthless falchion oped his tender side
  the panting liver pours a flood of gore
  that drowns his bosom till he pants no more.
  through mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear
  the warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear.
  thy life, echeclus! next the sword bereaves,
  deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves
  warm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies,
  the purple death comes floating o'er his eyes.
  then brave deucalion died  the dart was flung
  where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung
  he dropp'd his arm, an unassisting weight,
  and stood all impotent, expecting fate
  full on his neck the falling falchion sped,
  from his broad shoulders hew'd his crested head
  forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,
  and, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.
  rhigmas, whose race from fruitful thracia came,
   the son of pierus, an illustrious name,
  succeeds to fate  the spear his belly rends
  prone from his car the thundering chief descends.
  the squire, who saw expiring on the ground
  his prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around
  his back, scarce turn'd, the pelian javelin gored,
  and stretch'd the servant o'er his dying lord.
  as when a flame the winding valley fills,
  and runs on crackling shrubs between the hills
  then o'er the stubble up the mountain flies,
  fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,
  this way and that, the spreading torrent roars
  so sweeps the hero through the wasted shores
  around him wide, immense destruction pours
  and earth is deluged with the sanguine showers
  as with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er,
  and thick bestrewn, lies ceres' sacred floor
  when round and round, with never-wearied pain,
  the trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain
  so the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,
  tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls,
  dash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly,
  black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye
  the spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore
  and thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.
  high o'er the scene of death achilles stood,
  all grim with dust, all horrible in blood
  yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame
  such is the lust of never-dying fame!
  and now to xanthus' gliding stream they drove,
  xanthus, immortal progeny of jove.
  the river here divides the flying train,
  part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,
  where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,
  now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight
   these with a gathered mist saturnia shrouds,
  and rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds
  part plunge into the stream  old xanthus roars,
  the flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores
  with cries promiscuous all the banks resound,
  and here, and there, in eddies whirling round,
  the flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.
  as the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,
  while fast behind them runs the blaze of fire
  driven from the land before the smoky cloud,
  the clustering legions rush into the flood
  so, plunged in xanthus by achilles' force,
  roars the resounding surge with men and horse.
  his bloody lance the hero casts aside,
   which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,
  then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,
  arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves
  now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,
  deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound
  repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,
  and the warm purple circled on the tide.
  swift through the foamy flood the trojans fly,
  and close in rocks or winding caverns lie
  so the huge dolphin tempesting the main,
  in shoals before him fly the scaly train,
  confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,
  or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.
  now, tired with slaughter, from the trojan band
  twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land
  with their rich belts their captive arms restrains
   late their proud ornaments, but now their chains .
  these his attendants to the ships convey'd,
  sad victims destined to patroclus' shade
  then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,
  the young lycaon in his passage stood
  the son of priam  whom the hero's hand
  but late made captive in his father's land
   as from a sycamore, his sounding steel
  lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel
  to lemnos' isle he sold the royal slave,
  where jason's son the price demanded gave
  but kind eetion, touching on the shore,
  the ransom'd prince to fair arisbe bore.
  ten days were past, since in his father's reign
  he felt the sweets of liberty again
  the next, that god whom men in vain withstand
  gives the same youth to the same conquering hand
  now never to return! and doom'd to go
  a sadder journey to the shades below.
  his well-known face when great achilles eyed,
   the helm and visor he had cast aside
  with wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field
  his useless lance and unavailing shield,
  as trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,
  and knock'd his faltering knees, the hero said.
   ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!
  is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?
  sure i shall see yon heaps of trojans kill'd
  rise from the shades, and brave me on the field
  as now the captive, whom so late i bound
  and sold to lemnos, stalks on trojan ground!
  not him the sea's unmeasured deeps detain,
  that bar such numbers from their native plain
  lo! he returns. try, then, my flying spear!
  try, if the grave can hold the wanderer
  if earth, at length this active prince can seize,
  earth, whose strong grasp has held down hercules.
  thus while he spoke, the trojan pale with fears
  approach'd, and sought his knees with suppliant tears
  loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,
  and his soul shivering at the approach of death.
  achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound
  he kiss'd his feet, extended on the ground
  and while, above, the spear suspended stood,
  longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,
  one hand embraced them close, one stopp'd the dart,
  while thus these melting words attempt his heart
   thy well-known captive, great achilles! see,
  once more lycaon trembles at thy knee.
  some pity to a suppliant's name afford,
  who shared the gifts of ceres at thy board
  whom late thy conquering arm to lemnos bore,
  far from his father, friends, and native shore
  a hundred oxen were his price that day,
  now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.
  scarce respited from woes i yet appear,
  and scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here
  lo! jove again submits me to thy hands,
  again, her victim cruel fate demands!
  i sprang from priam, and laothoe fair,
   old altes' daughter, and lelegia's heir
  who held in pedasus his famed abode,
  and ruled the fields where silver satnio flow'd,
  two sons  alas! unhappy sons  she bore
  for ah! one spear shall drink each brother's gore,
  and i succeed to slaughter'd polydore.
  how from that arm of terror shall i fly?
  some demon urges! 'tis my doom to die!
  if ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind,
  ah! think not me too much of hector's kind!
  not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,
  with his, who wrought thy loved patroclus' death.
  these words, attended with a shower of tears,
  the youth address'd to unrelenting ears
   talk not of life, or ransom  he replies
  patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies
  in vain a single trojan sues for grace
  but least, the sons of priam's hateful race.
  die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?
  the great, the good patroclus is no more!
  he, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die,
  and thou, dost thou bewail mortality?
  seest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn,
  sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?
  the day shall come  which nothing can avert
  when by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,
  by night, or day, by force, or by design,
  impending death and certain fate are mine!
  die then, --he said  and as the word he spoke,
  the fainting stripling sank before the stroke
  his hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,
  while all his trembling frame confess'd his fear
  sudden, achilles his broad sword display'd,
  and buried in his neck the reeking blade.
  prone fell the youth  and panting on the land,
  the gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.
  the victor to the stream the carcase gave,
  and thus insults him, floating on the wave
   lie there, lycaon! let the fish surround
  thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound
  there no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,
  but swift scamander roll thee to the deep,
  whose every wave some watery monster brings,
  to feast unpunish'd on the fat of kings.
  so perish troy, and all the trojan line!
  such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.
  what boots ye now scamander's worshipp'd stream,
  his earthly honours, and immortal name?
  in vain your immolated bulls are slain,
  your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!
  thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate
  thus, till the grecian vengeance is complete
  thus is atoned patroclus' honour'd shade,
  and the short absence of achilles paid.
  these boastful words provoked the raging god
  with fury swells the violated flood.
  what means divine may yet the power employ
  to check achilles, and to rescue troy?
  meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare
  the great asteropeus to mortal war
  the son of pelagon, whose lofty line
  flows from the source of axius, stream divine!
   fair peribaea's love the god had crown'd,
  with all his refluent waters circled round
  on him achilles rush'd  he fearless stood,
  and shook two spears, advancing from the flood
  the flood impell'd him, on pelides' head
  to avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.
  near as they drew, achilles thus began
   what art thou, boldest of the race of man?
  who, or from whence? unhappy is the sire
  whose son encounters our resistless ire.
   o son of peleus! what avails to trace
   replied the warrior  our illustrious race?
  from rich paeonia's valleys i command,
  arm'd with protended spears, my native band
  now shines the tenth bright morning since i came
  in aid of ilion to the fields of fame
  axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,
  and wide around the floated region fills,
  begot my sire, whose spear much glory won
  now lift thy arm, and try that hero's son!
  threatening he said  the hostile chiefs advance
  at once asteropeus discharged each lance,
   for both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,
  one struck, but pierced not, the vulcanian shield
  one razed achilles' hand  the spouting blood
  spun forth  in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.
  like lightning next the pelean javelin flies
  its erring fury hiss'd along the skies
  deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,
  even to the middle earth  and quiver'd there.
  then from his side the sword pelides drew,
  and on his foe with double fury flew.
  the foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood
  repulsive of his might the weapon stood
  the fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain
  bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain
  his belly open'd with a ghastly wound,
  the reeking entrails pour upon the ground.
  beneath the hero's feet he panting lies,
  and his eye darkens, and his spirit flies
  while the proud victor thus triumphing said,
  his radiant armour tearing from the dead
   so ends thy glory! such the fate they prove,
  who strive presumptuous with the sons of jove!
  sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?
  but great saturnius is the source of mine.
  how durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?
  of peleus,  acus, and jove, am i.
  the race of these superior far to those,
  as he that thunders to the stream that flows.
  what rivers can, scamander might have shown
  but jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.
  even achelous might contend in vain,
  and all the roaring billows of the main.
  the eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow
  the seas, the rivers, and the springs below,
  the thundering voice of jove abhors to hear,
  and in his deep abysses shakes with fear.
  he said  then from the bank his javelin tore,
  and left the breathless warrior in his gore.
  the floating tides the bloody carcase lave,
  and beat against it, wave succeeding wave
  till, roll'd between the banks, it lies the food
  of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.
  all scatter'd round the stream  their mightiest slain
  the amazed paeonians scour along the plain
  he vents his fury on the flying crew,
  thrasius, astyplus, and mnesus slew
  mydon, thersilochus, with  nius, fell
  and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,
  but from the bottom of his gulfs profound
  scamander spoke  the shores return'd the sound.
   o first of mortals!  for the gods are thine
  in valour matchless, and in force divine!
  if jove have given thee every trojan head,
  'tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.
  see! my choked streams no more their course can keep,
  nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.
  turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood
  content, thy slaughters could amaze a god.
  in human form, confess'd before his eyes,
  the river thus  and thus the chief replies
   o sacred stream! thy word we shall obey
  but not till troy the destined vengeance pay,
  not till within her towers the perjured train
  shall pant, and tremble at our arms again
  not till proud hector, guardian of her wall,
  or stain this lance, or see achilles fall.
  he said  and drove with fury on the foe.
  then to the godhead of the silver bow
  the yellow flood began   o son of jove!
  was not the mandate of the sire above
  full and express, that phoebus should employ
  his sacred arrows in defence of troy,
  and make her conquer, till hyperion's fall
  in awful darkness hide the face of all?
  he spoke in vain--the chief without dismay
  ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.
  then rising in his rage above the shores,
  from all his deep the bellowing river roars,
  huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,
  and round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.
  while all before, the billows ranged on high,
   a watery bulwark,  screen the bands who fly.
  now bursting on his head with thundering sound,
  the falling deluge whelms the hero round
  his loaded shield bends to the rushing tide
  his feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,
  sliddering, and staggering. on the border stood
  a spreading elm, that overhung the flood
  he seized a bending bough, his steps to stay
  the plant uprooted to his weight gave way.
  heaving the bank, and undermining all
  loud flash the waters to the rushing fall
  of the thick foliage. the large trunk display'd
  bridged the rough flood across  the hero stay'd
  on this his weight, and raised upon his hand,
  leap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.
  then blacken'd the wild waves  the murmur rose
  the god pursues, a huger billow throws,
  and bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy
  the man whose fury is the fate of troy.
  he like the warlike eagle speeds his pace
   swiftest and strongest of the aerial race
  far as a spear can fly, achilles springs
  at every bound his clanging armour rings
  now here, now there, he turns on every side,
  and winds his course before the following tide
  the waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,
  and gather fast, and murmur at his heels.
  so when a peasant to his garden brings
  soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,
  and calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,
  and feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers
  soon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,
  and marks the future current with his spade,
  swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,
  louder and louder purl the falling rills
  before him scattering, they prevent his pains,
  and shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.
  still flies achilles, but before his eyes
  still swift scamander rolls where'er he flies
  not all his speed escapes the rapid floods
  the first of men, but not a match for gods.
  oft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,
  and bravely try if all the powers were foes
  so oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,
  beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.
  yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,
  and still indignant bounds above the waves.
  tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil
  wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil
  when thus  his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown
  forth bursts the hero with an angry groan
   is there no god achilles to befriend,
  no power to avert his miserable end?
  prevent, o jove! this ignominious date,
  and make my future life the sport of fate.
  of all heaven's oracles believed in vain,
  but most of thetis must her son complain
  by phoebus' darts she prophesied my fall,
  in glorious arms before the trojan wall.
  oh! had i died in fields of battle warm,
  stretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!
  might hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,
  and my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.
  ah no! achilles meets a shameful fate,
  oh how unworthy of the brave and great!
  like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,
  crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,
  an unregarded carcase to the sea.
  neptune and pallas haste to his relief,
  and thus in human form address'd the chief
  the power of ocean first   forbear thy fear,
  o son of peleus! lo, thy gods appear!
  behold! from jove descending to thy aid,
  propitious neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.
  stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave
  'tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.
  but thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!
  nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,
  till troy receive her flying sons, till all
  her routed squadrons pant behind their wall
  hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,
  and hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.
  thine is the glory doom'd.  thus spake the gods
  then swift ascended to the bright abodes.
  stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,
  he springs impetuous, and invades the field
  o'er all the expanded plain the waters spread
  heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,
  floating 'midst scatter'd arms  while casques of gold
  and turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.
  high o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,
  he wades, and mounts  the parted wave resounds.
  not a whole river stops the hero's course,
  while pallas fills him with immortal force.
  with equal rage, indignant xanthus roars,
  and lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.
  then thus to simois!  haste, my brother flood
  and check this mortal that controls a god
  our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,
  and ilion tumble from her towery height.
  call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,
  from all thy fountains swell thy watery store,
  with broken rocks, and with a load of dead,
  charge the black surge, and pour it on his head.
  mark how resistless through the floods he goes,
  and boldly bids the warring gods be foes!
  but nor that force, nor form divine to sight,
  shall aught avail him, if our rage unite
  whelm'd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,
  that blaze so dreadful in each trojan eye
  and deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl'd,
  immersed remain this terror of the world.
  such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,
  no greeks shall e'er his perish'd relics grace,
  no hand his bones shall gather, or inhume
  these his cold rites, and this his watery tomb.
  he said  and on the chief descends amain,
  increased with gore, and swelling with the slain.
  then, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,
  and a foam whitens on the purple waves
  at every step, before achilles stood
  the crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.
  fear touch'd the queen of heaven  she saw dismay'd,
  she call'd aloud, and summon'd vulcan's aid.
   rise to the war! the insulting flood requires
  thy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!
  while to their aid, by our command enjoin'd,
  rush the swift eastern and the western wind
  these from old ocean at my word shall blow,
  pour the red torrent on the watery foe,
  corses and arms to one bright ruin turn,
  and hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.
  go, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,
  drink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.
  scorch all the banks! and  till our voice reclaim
  exert the unwearied furies of the flame!
  the power ignipotent her word obeys
  wide o'er the plain he pours the boundless blaze
  at once consumes the dead, and dries the soil
  and the shrunk waters in their channel boil.
  as when autumnal boreas sweeps the sky,
  and instant blows the water'd gardens dry
  so look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground,
  while vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.
  swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys
  along the margin winds the running blaze
  the trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,
  the flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,
  broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire
  the watery willows hiss before the fire.
  now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,
  the eels lie twisting in the pangs of death
  now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,
  or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.
  at length the river rear'd his languid head,
  and thus, short-panting, to the god he said
   oh vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?
  i faint, i sink, unequal to the fight--
  i yield--let ilion fall  if fate decree--
  ah--bend no more thy fiery arms on me!
  he ceased  wide conflagration blazing round
  the bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.
  as when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,
  to melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,
  amid the fierce embrace of circling fires
  the waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires
  so boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow,
  and choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.
  to juno then, imperial queen of air,
  the burning river sends his earnest prayer
   ah why, saturnia  must thy son engage
  me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?
  on other gods his dreadful arm employ,
  for mightier gods assert the cause of troy.
  submissive i desist, if thou command
  but ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.
  hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate
  unaided ilion, and her destined state,
  till greece shall gird her with destructive flame,
  and in one ruin sink the trojan name.
  his warm entreaty touch'd saturnia's ear
  she bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,
  recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause
  infest a god  the obedient flame withdraws
  again the branching streams begin to spread,
  and soft remurmur in their wonted bed.
  while these by juno's will the strife resign,
  the warring gods in fierce contention join
  rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms
  with horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms
  heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound
  and wide beneath them groans the rending ground.
  jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,
  and views contending gods with careless eyes.
  the power of battles lifts his brazen spear,
  and first assaults the radiant queen of war
   what moved thy madness, thus to disunite
  ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?
  what wonder this, when in thy frantic mood
  thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?
  thy impious hand tydides' javelin bore,
  and madly bathed it in celestial gore.
  he spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,
  which bears jove's thunder on its dreadful field
  the adamantine aegis of her sire,
  that turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.
  then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand
  a stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,
  there fix'd from eldest times  black, craggy, vast
  this at the heavenly homicide she cast.
  thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size
  and seven broad acres covers as he lies.
  the stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound
  loud o'er the fields his ringing arms resound
  the scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,
  and, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles
   hast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known
  how far minerva's force transcends thy own?
  juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,
  corrects thy folly thus by pallas' hand
  thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,
  and partial aid to troy's perfidious race.
  the goddess spoke, and turn'd her eyes away,
  that, beaming round, diffused celestial day.
  jove's cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,
  lent to the wounded god her tender hand
  slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,
  and, propp'd on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.
  this the bright empress of the heavens survey'd,
  and, scoffing, thus to war's victorious maid
   lo! what an aid on mars's side is seen!
  the smiles' and loves' unconquerable queen!
  mark with what insolence, in open view,
  she moves  let pallas, if she dares, pursue.
  minerva smiling heard, the pair o'ertook,
  and slightly on her breast the wanton strook
  she, unresisting, fell  her spirits fled
  on earth together lay the lovers spread.
   and like these heroes be the fate of all
   minerva cries  who guard the trojan wall!
  to grecian gods such let the phrygian be,
  so dread, so fierce, as venus is to me
  then from the lowest stone shall troy be moved.
  thus she, and juno with a smile approved.
  meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,
  the god of ocean dares the god of light.
   what sloth has seized us, when the fields around
  ring with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound
  shall, ignominious, we with shame retire,
  no deed perform'd, to our olympian sire?
  come, prove thy arm! for first the war to wage,
  suits not my greatness, or superior age
  rash as thou art to prop the trojan throne,
   forgetful of my wrongs, and of thy own,
  and guard the race of proud laomedon!
  hast thou forgot, how, at the monarch's prayer,
  we shared the lengthen'd labours of a year?
  troy walls i raised  for such were jove's commands ,
  and yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands
  thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves
  along fair ida's vales and pendant groves.
  but when the circling seasons in their train
  brought back the grateful day that crown'd our pain,
  with menace stern the fraudful king defied
  our latent godhead, and the prize denied
  mad as he was, he threaten'd servile bands,
  and doom'd us exiles far in barbarous lands.
  incensed, we heavenward fled with swiftest wing,
  and destined vengeance on the perjured king.
  dost thou, for this, afford proud ilion grace,
  and not, like us, infest the faithless race
  like us, their present, future sons destroy,
  and from its deep foundations heave their troy?
  apollo thus   to combat for mankind
  ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind
  for what is man? calamitous by birth,
  they owe their life and nourishment to earth
  like yearly leaves, that now, with beauty crown'd,
  smile on the sun  now, wither on the ground.
  to their own hands commit the frantic scene,
  nor mix immortals in a cause so mean.
  then turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,
  and from the senior power submiss retires
  him thus retreating, artemis upbraids,
  the quiver'd huntress of the sylvan shades
   and is it thus the youthful phoebus flies,
  and yields to ocean's hoary sire the prize?
  how vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show
  of pointed arrows and the silver bow!
  now boast no more in yon celestial bower,
  thy force can match the great earth-shaking power.
  silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid
  not so saturnia bore the vaunting maid
  but furious thus   what insolence has driven
  thy pride to face the majesty of heaven?
  what though by jove the female plague design'd,
  fierce to the feeble race of womankind,
  the wretched matron feels thy piercing dart
  thy sex's tyrant, with a tiger's heart?
  what though tremendous in the woodland chase
  thy certain arrows pierce the savage race?
  how dares thy rashness on the powers divine
  employ those arms, or match thy force with mine?
  learn hence, no more unequal war to wage--
  she said, and seized her wrists with eager rage
  these in her left hand lock'd, her right untied
  the bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.
  about her temples flies the busy bow
  now here, now there, she winds her from the blow
  the scattering arrows, rattling from the case,
  drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.
  swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,
  and scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes
  so, when the falcon wings her way above,
  to the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove
   not fated yet to die   there safe retreats,
  yet still her heart against the marble beats.
  to her latona hastes with tender care
  whom hermes viewing, thus declines the war
   how shall i face the dame, who gives delight
  to him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?
  go, matchless goddess! triumph in the skies,
  and boast my conquest, while i yield the prize.
  he spoke  and pass'd  latona, stooping low,
  collects the scatter'd shafts and fallen bow,
  that, glittering on the dust, lay here and there
  dishonour'd relics of diana's war
  then swift pursued her to her blest abode,
  where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god
  weeping, she grasp'd his knees  the ambrosial vest
  shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.
  the sire superior smiled, and bade her show
  what heavenly hand had caused his daughter's woe?
  abash'd, she names his own imperial spouse
  and the pale crescent fades upon her brows.
  thus they above  while, swiftly gliding down,
  apollo enters ilion's sacred town
  the guardian-god now trembled for her wall,
  and fear'd the greeks, though fate forbade her fall.
  back to olympus, from the war's alarms,
  return the shining bands of gods in arms
  some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire
  and take their thrones around the ethereal sire.
  through blood, through death, achilles still proceeds,
  o'er slaughter'd heroes, and o'er rolling steeds.
  as when avenging flames with fury driven
  on guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven
  the pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly
  and the red vapours purple all the sky
  so raged achilles  death and dire dismay,
  and toils, and terrors, fill'd the dreadful day.
  high on a turret hoary priam stands,
  and marks the waste of his destructive hands
  views, from his arm, the trojans' scatter'd flight,
  and the near hero rising on his sight!
  no stop, no check, no aid! with feeble pace,
  and settled sorrow on his aged face,
  fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls
  and thus descending, on the guards he calls
   you to whose care our city-gates belong,
  set wide your portals to the flying throng
  for lo! he comes, with unresisted sway
  he comes, and desolation marks his way!
  but when within the walls our troops take breath,
  lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.
  thus charged the reverend monarch  wide were flung
  the opening folds  the sounding hinges rung.
  phoebus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet
  struck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,
  on heaps the trojans crowd to gain the gate,
  and gladsome see their last escape from fate.
  thither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,
  hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain
  and gasping, panting, fainting, labour on
  with heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.
  enraged achilles follows with his spear
  wild with revenge, insatiable of war.
  then had the greeks eternal praise acquired,
  and troy inglorious to her walls retired
  but he, the god who darts ethereal flame,
  shot down to save her, and redeem her fame
  to young agenor force divine he gave
   antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave
  in aid of him, beside the beech he sate,
  and wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.
  when now the generous youth achilles spies.
  thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.
   so, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.
  he stops, and questions thus his mighty soul
   what, shall i fly this terror of the plain!
  like others fly, and be like others slain?
  vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road
  yon line of slaughter'd trojans lately trod.
  no  with the common heap i scorn to fall--
  what if they pass'd me to the trojan wall,
  while i decline to yonder path, that leads
  to ida's forests and surrounding shades?
  so may i reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,
  from my tired body wash the dirt and blood,
  as soon as night her dusky veil extends,
  return in safety to my trojan friends.
  what if?--but wherefore all this vain debate?
  stand i to doubt, within the reach of fate?
  even now perhaps, ere yet i turn the wall,
  the fierce achilles sees me, and i fall
  such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,
  and such his valour, that who stands must die.
  howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,
  here, and in public view, to meet my fate.
  yet sure he too is mortal  he may feel
   like all the sons of earth  the force of steel.
  one only soul informs that dreadful frame
  and jove's sole favour gives him all his fame.
  he said, and stood, collected, in his might
  and all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.
  so from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,
  roused from his thicket by a storm of darts
  untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds
  of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds
  though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain
  and the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain
  on their whole war, untamed, the savage flies
  and tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.
  not less resolved, antenor's valiant heir
  confronts achilles, and awaits the war,
  disdainful of retreat  high held before,
  his shield  a broad circumference  he bore
  then graceful as he stood, in act to throw
  the lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe
   how proud achilles glories in his fame!
  and hopes this day to sink the trojan name
  beneath her ruins! know, that hope is vain
  a thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.
  parents and children our just arms employ,
  and strong and many are the sons of troy.
  great as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore
  these phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.
  he said  with matchless force the javelin flung
  smote on his knee  the hollow cuishes rung
  beneath the pointed steel  but safe from harms
  he stands impassive in the ethereal arms.
  then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,
  his lifted arm prepares the fatal blow
  but, jealous of his fame, apollo shrouds
  the god-like trojan in a veil of clouds.
  safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,
  dismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.
  meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,
  assumes agenor's habit, voice and shape,
  flies from the furious chief in this disguise
  the furious chief still follows where he flies.
  now o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,
  now urge the course where swift scamander glides
  the god, now distant scarce a stride before,
  tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore
  while all the flying troops their speed employ,
  and pour on heaps into the walls of troy
  no stop, no stay  no thought to ask, or tell,
  who 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.
  'twas tumult all, and violence of flight
  and sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.
  pale troy against achilles shuts her gate
  and nations breathe, deliver'd from their fate.
book xxii.
argument.
the death of hector.
the trojans being safe within the walls, hector only stays to oppose
achilles. priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his son
to re-enter the town. hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain. hector
consults within himself what measures to take  but at the advance of
achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. achilles pursues him
thrice round the walls of troy. the gods debate concerning the fate of
hector  at length minerva descends to the aid of achilles. she deludes
hector in the shape of deiphobus  he stands the combat, and is slain.
achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of priam and
hecuba. their lamentations, tears, and despair. their cries reach the ears
of andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into the inner part of
the palace  she mounts up to the walls, and beholds her dead husband. she
swoons at the spectacle. her excess of grief and lamentation.
the thirtieth day still continues. the scene lies under the walls, and on
the battlements of troy.
  thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,
  the herded ilians rush like driven deer
  there safe they wipe the briny drops away,
  and drown in bowls the labours of the day.
  close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields
  beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,
  march, bending on, the greeks' embodied powers,
  far stretching in the shade of trojan towers.
  great hector singly stay'd  chain'd down by fate
  there fix'd he stood before the scaean gate
  still his bold arms determined to employ,
  the guardian still of long-defended troy.
  apollo now to tired achilles turns
   the power confess'd in all his glory burns
   and what  he cries  has peleus' son in view,
  with mortal speed a godhead to pursue?
  for not to thee to know the gods is given,
  unskill'd to trace the latent marks of heaven.
  what boots thee now, that troy forsook the plain?
  vain thy past labour, and thy present vain
  safe in their walls are now her troops bestow'd,
  while here thy frantic rage attacks a god.
  the chief incensed-- too partial god of day!
  to check my conquests in the middle way
  how few in ilion else had refuge found!
  what gasping numbers now had bit the ground!
  thou robb'st me of a glory justly mine,
  powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine
  mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,
  to cheat a mortal who repines in vain.
  then to the city, terrible and strong,
  with high and haughty steps he tower'd along,
  so the proud courser, victor of the prize,
  to the near goal with double ardour flies.
  him, as he blazing shot across the field,
  the careful eyes of priam first beheld.
  not half so dreadful rises to the sight,
  through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,
  orion's dog  the year when autumn weighs ,
  and o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays
  terrific glory! for his burning breath
  taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.
  so flamed his fiery mail. then wept the sage
  he strikes his reverend head, now white with age
  he lifts his wither'd arms  obtests the skies
  he calls his much-loved son with feeble cries
  the son, resolved achilles' force to dare,
  full at the scaean gates expects the war
  while the sad father on the rampart stands,
  and thus adjures him with extended hands
   ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone
  hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!
  methinks already i behold thee slain,
  and stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.
  implacable achilles! might'st thou be
  to all the gods no dearer than to me!
  thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore.
  and bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.
  how many valiant sons i late enjoy'd,
  valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd
  or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles
  to shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.
  two, while i speak, my eyes in vain explore,
  two from one mother sprung, my polydore,
  and loved lycaon  now perhaps no more!
  oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,
  what heaps of gold, what treasures would i give!
   their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,
  consign'd his daughter with lelegia's throne
  but if  which heaven forbid  already lost,
  all pale they wander on the stygian coast
  what sorrows then must their sad mother know,
  what anguish i? unutterable woe!
  yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,
  less to all troy, if not deprived of thee.
  yet shun achilles! enter yet the wall
  and spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!
  save thy dear life  or, if a soul so brave
  neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.
  pity, while yet i live, these silver hairs
  while yet thy father feels the woes he bears,
  yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage
   all trembling on the verge of helpless age
  great jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!
  the bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain
  to fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,
  and number all his days by miseries!
  my heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,
  my daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,
  my bleeding infants dash'd against the floor
  these i have yet to see, perhaps yet more!
  perhaps even i, reserved by angry fate,
  the last sad relic of my ruin'd state,
   dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!  must fall,
  and stain the pavement of my regal hall
  where famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,
  shall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.
  yet for my sons i thank ye, gods! 'tis well
  well have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.
  who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,
  struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.
  but when the fates, in fulness of their rage,
  spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,
  in dust the reverend lineaments deform,
  and pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm
  this, this is misery! the last, the worse,
  that man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!
  he said, and acting what no words could say,
  rent from his head the silver locks away.
  with him the mournful mother bears a part
  yet all her sorrows turn not hector's heart.
  the zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd
  and thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said
   have mercy on me, o my son! revere
  the words of age  attend a parent's prayer!
  if ever thee in these fond arms i press'd,
  or still'd thy infant clamours at this breast
  ah do not thus our helpless years forego,
  but, by our walls secured, repel the foe.
  against his rage if singly thou proceed,
  should'st thou,  but heaven avert it!  should'st thou bleed,
  nor must thy corse lie honour'd on the bier,
  nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!
  far from our pious rites those dear remains
  must feast the vultures on the naked plains.
  so they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll
  but fix'd remains the purpose of his soul
  resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance
  expects the hero's terrible advance.
  so, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake
  beholds the traveller approach the brake
  when fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins
  have gather'd half the poisons of the plains
  he burns, he stiffens with collected ire,
  and his red eyeballs glare with living fire.
  beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,
  he stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind
   where lies my way? to enter in the wall?
  honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall
  shall proud polydamas before the gate
  proclaim, his counsels are obey'd too late,
  which timely follow'd but the former night,
  what numbers had been saved by hector's flight?
  that wise advice rejected with disdain,
  i feel my folly in my people slain.
  methinks my suffering country's voice i hear,
  but most her worthless sons insult my ear,
  on my rash courage charge the chance of war,
  and blame those virtues which they cannot share.
  no--if i e'er return, return i must
  glorious, my country's terror laid in dust
  or if i perish, let her see me fall
  in field at least, and fighting for her wall.
  and yet suppose these measures i forego,
  approach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,
  the warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down.
  and treat on terms of peace to save the town
  the wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain'd
   cause of the war, and grievance of the land
  with honourable justice to restore
  and add half ilion's yet remaining store,
  which troy shall, sworn, produce  that injured greece
  may share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.
  but why this thought? unarm'd if i should go,
  what hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,
  but woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?
  we greet not here, as man conversing man,
  met at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain
  no season now for calm familiar talk,
  like youths and maidens in an evening walk
  war is our business, but to whom is given
  to die, or triumph, that, determine heaven!
  thus pondering, like a god the greek drew nigh
  his dreadful plumage nodded from on high
  the pelian javelin, in his better hand,
  shot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land
  and on his breast the beamy splendour shone,
  like jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.
  as hector sees, unusual terrors rise,
  struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.
  he leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind
  achilles follows like the winged wind.
  thus at the panting dove a falcon flies
   the swiftest racer of the liquid skies ,
  just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,
  obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,
  with open beak and shrilling cries he springs,
  and aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings
  no less fore-right the rapid chase they held,
  one urged by fury, one by fear impell'd
  now circling round the walls their course maintain,
  where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain
  now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,
   a wider compass,  smoke along the road.
  next by scamander's double source they bound,
  where two famed fountains burst the parted ground
  this hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,
  with exhalations steaming to the skies
  that the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,
  like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows
  each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,
  whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills
  where trojan dames  ere yet alarm'd by greece
  wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.
  by these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight
   the mighty fled, pursued by stronger might
  swift was the course  no vulgar prize they play,
  no vulgar victim must reward the day
   such as in races crown the speedy strife
  the prize contended was great hector's life.
  as when some hero's funerals are decreed
  in grateful honour of the mighty dead
  where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame
   some golden tripod, or some lovely dame
  the panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,
  and with them turns the raised spectator's soul
  thus three times round the trojan wall they fly.
  the gazing gods lean forward from the sky
  to whom, while eager on the chase they look,
  the sire of mortals and immortals spoke
   unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,
  behold, inglorious round yon city driven!
  my heart partakes the generous hector's pain
  hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,
  whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,
  from ida's summits, and the towers of troy
  now see him flying  to his fears resign'd,
  and fate, and fierce achilles, close behind.
  consult, ye powers!  'tis worthy your debate
  whether to snatch him from impending fate,
  or let him bear, by stern pelides slain,
   good as he is  the lot imposed on man.
  then pallas thus   shall he whose vengeance forms
  the forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,
  shall he prolong one trojan's forfeit breath?
  a man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death!
  and will no murmurs fill the courts above?
  no gods indignant blame their partial jove?
   go then  return'd the sire  without delay,
  exert thy will  i give the fates their way.
  swift at the mandate pleased tritonia flies,
  and stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.
  as through the forest, o'er the vale and lawn,
  the well-breath'd beagle drives the flying fawn,
  in vain he tries the covert of the brakes,
  or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes
  sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,
  the certain hound his various maze pursues.
  thus step by step, where'er the trojan wheel'd,
  there swift achilles compass'd round the field.
  oft as to reach the dardan gates he bends,
  and hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,
   whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,
  from the high turrets might oppress the foe,
  so oft achilles turns him to the plain
  he eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.
  as men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,
  one to pursue, and one to lead the chase,
  their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,
  nor this can fly, nor that can overtake
  no less the labouring heroes pant and strain
  while that but flies, and this pursues in vain.
  what god, o muse, assisted hector's force
  with fate itself so long to hold the course?
  phoebus it was  who, in his latest hour,
  endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power
  and great achilles, lest some greek's advance
  should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,
  sign'd to the troops to yield his foe the way,
  and leave untouch'd the honours of the day.
  jove lifts the golden balances, that show
  the fates of mortal men, and things below
  here each contending hero's lot he tries,
  and weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.
  low sinks the scale surcharged with hector's fate
  heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.
  then phoebus left him. fierce minerva flies
  to stern pelides, and triumphing, cries
   o loved of jove! this day our labours cease,
  and conquest blazes with full beams on greece.
  great hector falls  that hector famed so far,
  drunk with renown, insatiable of war,
  falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,
  shall more avail him, nor his god of light.
  see, where in vain he supplicates above,
  roll'd at the feet of unrelenting jove
  rest here  myself will lead the trojan on,
  and urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.
  her voice divine the chief with joyful mind
  obey'd  and rested, on his lance reclined
  while like deiphobus the martial dame
   her face, her gesture, and her arms the same ,
  in show an aid, by hapless hector's side
  approach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied
   too long, o hector! have i borne the sight
  of this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight
  it fits us now a noble stand to make,
  and here, as brothers, equal fates partake.
  then he   o prince! allied in blood and fame,
  dearer than all that own a brother's name
  of all that hecuba to priam bore,
  long tried, long loved  much loved, but honoured more!
  since you, of all our numerous race alone
  defend my life, regardless of your own.
  again the goddess   much my father's prayer,
  and much my mother's, press'd me to forbear
  my friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,
  but stronger love impell'd, and i obey.
  come then, the glorious conflict let us try,
  let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly
  or let us stretch achilles on the field,
  or to his arm our bloody trophies yield.
  fraudful she said  then swiftly march'd before
  the dardan hero shuns his foe no more.
  sternly they met. the silence hector broke
  his dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke
   enough, o son of peleus! troy has view'd
  her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.
  but now some god within me bids me try
  thine, or my fate  i kill thee, or i die.
  yet on the verge of battle let us stay,
  and for a moment's space suspend the day
  let heaven's high powers be call'd to arbitrate
  the just conditions of this stern debate,
   eternal witnesses of all below,
  and faithful guardians of the treasured vow!
  to them i swear  if, victor in the strife,
  jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,
  no vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue
  stripp'd of its arms alone  the conqueror's due
  the rest to greece uninjured i'll restore
  now plight thy mutual oath, i ask no more.
   talk not of oaths  the dreadful chief replies,
  while anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes ,
  detested as thou art, and ought to be,
  nor oath nor pact achilles plights with thee
  such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,
  such leagues as men and furious lions join,
  to such i call the gods! one constant state
  of lasting rancour and eternal hate
  no thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,
  till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.
  rouse then thy forces this important hour,
  collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.
  no further subterfuge, no further chance
  'tis pallas, pallas gives thee to my lance.
  each grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,
  now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death.
  he spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe
  but hector shunn'd the meditated blow
  he stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear
  sang innocent, and spent its force in air.
  minerva watch'd it falling on the land,
  then drew, and gave to great achilles' hand,
  unseen of hector, who, elate with joy,
  now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of troy.
   the life you boasted to that javelin given,
  prince! you have miss'd. my fate depends on heaven,
  to thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,
  or what must prove my fortune, or thy own.
  boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,
  and with false terrors sink another's mind.
  but know, whatever fate i am to try,
  by no dishonest wound shall hector die.
  i shall not fall a fugitive at least,
  my soul shall bravely issue from my breast.
  but first, try thou my arm  and may this dart
  end all my country's woes, deep buried in thy heart.
  the weapon flew, its course unerring held,
  unerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd
  the mortal dart  resulting with a bound
  from off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.
  hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,
  nor other lance, nor other hope remain
  he calls deiphobus, demands a spear--
  in vain, for no deiphobus was there.
  all comfortless he stands  then, with a sigh
   'tis so--heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!
  i deem'd deiphobus had heard my call,
  but he secure lies guarded in the wall.
  a god deceived me  pallas, 'twas thy deed,
  death and black fate approach! 'tis i must bleed.
  no refuge now, no succour from above,
  great jove deserts me, and the son of jove,
  propitious once, and kind! then welcome fate!
  'tis true i perish, yet i perish great
  yet in a mighty deed i shall expire,
  let future ages hear it, and admire!
  fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,
  and, all collected, on achilles flew.
  so jove's bold bird, high balanced in the air,
  stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.
  nor less achilles his fierce soul prepares
  before his breast the flaming shield he bears,
  refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone
  the gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.
  nodding at every step   vulcanian frame!
  and as he moved, his figure seem'd on flame.
  as radiant hesper shines with keener light,
  far-beaming o'er the silver host of night,
  when all the starry train emblaze the sphere
  so shone the point of great achilles' spear.
  in his right hand he waves the weapon round,
  eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound
  but the rich mail patroclus lately wore
  securely cased the warrior's body o'er.
  one space at length he spies, to let in fate,
  where 'twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate
  gave entrance  through that penetrable part
  furious he drove the well-directed dart
  nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power
  of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.
  prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,
  while, thus triumphing, stern achilles cries
   at last is hector stretch'd upon the plain,
  who fear'd no vengeance for patroclus slain
  then, prince! you should have fear'd, what now you feel
  achilles absent was achilles still
  yet a short space the great avenger stayed,
  then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.
  peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn'd,
  for ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd
  while cast to all the rage of hostile power,
  thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour.
  then hector, fainting at the approach of death
   by thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!
  by all the sacred prevalence of prayer
  ah, leave me not for grecian dogs to tear!
  the common rites of sepulture bestow,
  to soothe a father's and a mother's woe
  let their large gifts procure an urn at least,
  and hector's ashes in his country rest.
   no, wretch accursed! relentless he replies
   flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes
  not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,
  nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.
  could i myself the bloody banquet join!
  no--to the dogs that carcase i resign.
  should troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,
  and giving thousands, offer thousands more
  should dardan priam, and his weeping dame,
  drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame
  their hector on the pile they should not see,
  nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee.
  then thus the chief his dying accents drew
   thy rage, implacable! too well i knew
  the furies that relentless breast have steel'd,
  and cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.
  yet think, a day will come, when fate's decree
  and angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee
  phoebus and paris shall avenge my fate,
  and stretch thee here before the scaean gate.
  he ceased. the fates suppress'd his labouring breath,
  and his eyes stiffen'd at the hand of death
  to the dark realm the spirit wings its way,
   the manly body left a load of clay,
  and plaintive glides along the dreary coast,
  a naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!
  achilles, musing as he roll'd his eyes
  o'er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies
   die thou the first! when jove and heaven ordain,
  i follow thee --he said, and stripp'd the slain.
  then forcing backward from the gaping wound
  the reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.
  the thronging greeks behold with wondering eyes
  his manly beauty and superior size
  while some, ignobler, the great dead deface
  with wounds ungenerous, or with taunts disgrace
   how changed that hector, who like jove of late
  sent lightning on our fleets, and scatter'd fate!
  high o'er the slain the great achilles stands,
  begirt with heroes and surrounding bands
  and thus aloud, while all the host attends
   princes and leaders! countrymen and friends!
  since now at length the powerful will of heaven
  the dire destroyer to our arm has given,
  is not troy fallen already? haste, ye powers!
  see, if already their deserted towers
  are left unmann'd  or if they yet retain
  the souls of heroes, their great hector slain.
  but what is troy, or glory what to me?
  or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,
  divine patroclus! death hath seal'd his eyes
  unwept, unhonour'd, uninterr'd he lies!
  can his dear image from my soul depart,
  long as the vital spirit moves my heart?
  if in the melancholy shades below,
  the flames of friends and lovers cease to glow,
  yet mine shall sacred last  mine, undecay'd,
  burn on through death, and animate my shade.
  meanwhile, ye sons of greece, in triumph bring
  the corpse of hector, and your paeans sing.
  be this the song, slow-moving toward the shore,
   hector is dead, and ilion is no more.
  then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred
   unworthy of himself, and of the dead
  the nervous ancles bored, his feet he bound
  with thongs inserted through the double wound
  these fix'd up high behind the rolling wain,
  his graceful head was trail'd along the plain.
  proud on his car the insulting victor stood,
  and bore aloft his arms, distilling blood.
  he smites the steeds  the rapid chariot flies
  the sudden clouds of circling dust arise.
  now lost is all that formidable air
  the face divine, and long-descending hair,
  purple the ground, and streak the sable sand
  deform'd, dishonour'd, in his native land,
  given to the rage of an insulting throng,
  and, in his parents' sight, now dragg'd along!
  the mother first beheld with sad survey
  she rent her tresses, venerable grey,
  and cast, far off, the regal veils away.
  with piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans,
  while the sad father answers groans with groans
  tears after tears his mournful cheeks o'erflow,
  and the whole city wears one face of woe
  no less than if the rage of hostile fires.
  from her foundations curling to her spires,
  o'er the proud citadel at length should rise,
  and the last blaze send ilion to the skies.
  the wretched monarch of the falling state,
  distracted, presses to the dardan gate.
  scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,
  while strong affliction gives the feeble force
  grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,
  in all the raging impotence of woe.
  at length he roll'd in dust, and thus begun,
  imploring all, and naming one by one
   ah! let me, let me go where sorrow calls
  i, only i, will issue from your walls
   guide or companion, friends! i ask ye none ,
  and bow before the murderer of my son.
  my grief perhaps his pity may engage
  perhaps at least he may respect my age.
  he has a father too  a man like me
  one, not exempt from age and misery
   vigorous no more, as when his young embrace
  begot this pest of me, and all my race .
  how many valiant sons, in early bloom,
  has that cursed hand send headlong to the tomb!
  thee, hector! last  thy loss  divinely brave
  sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave.
  o had thy gentle spirit pass'd in peace,
  the son expiring in the sire's embrace,
  while both thy parents wept the fatal hour,
  and, bending o'er thee, mix'd the tender shower!
  some comfort that had been, some sad relief,
  to melt in full satiety of grief!
  thus wail'd the father, grovelling on the ground,
  and all the eyes of ilion stream'd around.
  amidst her matrons hecuba appears
   a mourning princess, and a train in tears
   ah why has heaven prolong'd this hated breath,
  patient of horrors, to behold thy death?
  o hector! late thy parents' pride and joy,
  the boast of nations! the defence of troy!
  to whom her safety and her fame she owed
  her chief, her hero, and almost her god!
  o fatal change! become in one sad day
  a senseless corse! inanimated clay!
  but not as yet the fatal news had spread
  to fair andromache, of hector dead
  as yet no messenger had told his fate,
  not e'en his stay without the scaean gate.
  far in the close recesses of the dome,
  pensive she plied the melancholy loom
  a growing work employ'd her secret hours,
  confusedly gay with intermingled flowers.
  her fair-haired handmaids heat the brazen urn,
  the bath preparing for her lord's return
  in vain  alas! her lord returns no more
  unbathed he lies, and bleeds along the shore!
  now from the walls the clamours reach her ear,
  and all her members shake with sudden fear
  forth from her ivory hand the shuttle falls,
  and thus, astonish'd, to her maids she calls
   ah follow me!  she cried  what plaintive noise
  invades my ear? 'tis sure my mother's voice.
  my faltering knees their trembling frame desert,
  a pulse unusual flutters at my heart
  some strange disaster, some reverse of fate
   ye gods avert it!  threats the trojan state.
  far be the omen which my thoughts suggest!
  but much i fear my hector's dauntless breast
  confronts achilles  chased along the plain,
  shut from our walls! i fear, i fear him slain!
  safe in the crowd he ever scorn'd to wait,
  and sought for glory in the jaws of fate
  perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath,
  now quench'd for ever in the arms of death.
  she spoke  and furious, with distracted pace,
  fears in her heart, and anguish in her face,
  flies through the dome  the maids her steps pursue ,
  and mounts the walls, and sends around her view.
  too soon her eyes the killing object found,
  the godlike hector dragg'd along the ground.
  a sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes
  she faints, she falls  her breath, her colour flies.
  her hair's fair ornaments, the braids that bound,
  the net that held them, and the wreath that crown'd,
  the veil and diadem flew far away
   the gift of venus on her bridal day .
  around a train of weeping sisters stands,
  to raise her sinking with assistant hands.
  scarce from the verge of death recall'd, again
  she faints, or but recovers to complain.
   o wretched husband of a wretched wife!
  born with one fate, to one unhappy life!
  for sure one star its baneful beam display'd
  on priam's roof, and hippoplacia's shade.
  from different parents, different climes we came.
  at different periods, yet our fate the same!
  why was my birth to great aetion owed,
  and why was all that tender care bestow'd?
  would i had never been!--o thou, the ghost
  of my dead husband! miserably lost!
  thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!
  and i abandon'd, desolate, alone!
  an only child, once comfort of my pains,
  sad product now of hapless love, remains!
  no more to smile upon his sire  no friend
  to help him now! no father to defend!
  for should he 'scape the sword, the common doom,
  what wrongs attend him, and what griefs to come!
  even from his own paternal roof expell'd,
  some stranger ploughs his patrimonial field.
  the day, that to the shades the father sends,
  robs the sad orphan of his father's friends
  he, wretched outcast of mankind! appears
  for ever sad, for ever bathed in tears
  amongst the happy, unregarded, he
  hangs on the robe, or trembles at the knee,
  while those his father's former bounty fed
  nor reach the goblet, nor divide the bread
  the kindest but his present wants allay,
  to leave him wretched the succeeding day.
  frugal compassion! heedless, they who boast
  both parents still, nor feel what he has lost,
  shall cry, 'begone! thy father feasts not here '
  the wretch obeys, retiring with a tear.
  thus wretched, thus retiring all in tears,
  to my sad soul astyanax appears!
  forced by repeated insults to return,
  and to his widow'd mother vainly mourn
  he, who, with tender delicacy bred,
  with princes sported, and on dainties fed,
  and when still evening gave him up to rest,
  sunk soft in down upon the nurse's breast,
  must--ah what must he not? whom ilion calls
  astyanax, from her well-guarded walls,
  is now that name no more, unhappy boy!
  since now no more thy father guards his troy.
  but thou, my hector, liest exposed in air,
  far from thy parents' and thy consort's care
  whose hand in vain, directed by her love,
  the martial scarf and robe of triumph wove.
  now to devouring flames be these a prey,
  useless to thee, from this accursed day!
  yet let the sacrifice at least be paid,
  an honour to the living, not the dead!
  so spake the mournful dame  her matrons hear,
  sigh back her sighs, and answer tear with tear.
book xxiii.
argument.
funeral games in honour of patroclus.
achilles and the myrmidons do honours to the body of patroclus. after the
funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep, the
ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of burial  the
next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood
for the pyre. the funeral procession, and the offering their hair to the
dead. achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly twelve trojan
captives, at the pile  then sets fire to it. he pays libations to the
winds, which  at the instance of iris  rise, and raise the flames. when
the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones, place them in an urn
of gold, and raise the tomb. achilles institutes the funeral games  the
chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the wrestling, the foot-race, the
single combat, the discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the
javelin  the various descriptions of which, and the various success of the
several antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.
in this book ends the thirtieth day. the night following, the ghost of
patroclus appears to achilles  the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in
felling the timber for the pile  the two-and-thirtieth in burning it  and
the three-and-thirtieth in the games. the scene is generally on the
sea-shore.
  thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train
  through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain.
  the body soil'd with dust, and black with gore,
  lies on broad hellespont's resounding shore.
  the grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,
  all, but the martial myrmidonian band
  these yet assembled great achilles holds,
  and the stern purpose of his mind unfolds
   not yet, my brave companions of the war,
  release your smoking coursers from the car
  but, with his chariot each in order led,
  perform due honours to patroclus dead.
  ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,
  some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief.
  the troops obey'd  and thrice in order led
   achilles first  their coursers round the dead
  and thrice their sorrows and laments renew
  tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.
  for such a warrior thetis aids their woe,
  melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.
  but chief, pelides  thick-succeeding sighs
  burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes
  his slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid
  on his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said
   all hail, patroclus! let thy honour'd ghost
  hear, and rejoice on pluto's dreary coast
  behold! achilles' promise is complete
  the bloody hector stretch'd before thy feet.
  lo! to the dogs his carcase i resign
  and twelve sad victims, of the trojan line,
  sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire
  their lives effused around thy funeral pyre.
  gloomy he said, and  horrible to view
  before the bier the bleeding hector threw,
  prone on the dust. the myrmidons around
  unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.
  all to achilles' sable ship repair,
  frequent and full, the genial feast to share.
  now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,
  the bristly victims hissing o'er the fire
  the huge ox bellowing falls  with feebler cries
  expires the goat  the sheep in silence dies.
  around the hero's prostrate body flow'd,
  in one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.
  and now a band of argive monarchs brings
  the glorious victor to the king of kings.
  from his dead friend the pensive warrior went,
  with steps unwilling, to the regal tent.
  the attending heralds, as by office bound,
  with kindled flames the tripod-vase surround
  to cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,
  they urged in vain  the chief refused, and swore
   no drop shall touch me, by almighty jove!
  the first and greatest of the gods above!
  till on the pyre i place thee  till i rear
  the grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.
  some ease at least those pious rites may give,
  and soothe my sorrows, while i bear to live.
  howe'er, reluctant as i am, i stay
  and share your feast  but with the dawn of day,
   o king of men!  it claims thy royal care,
  that greece the warrior's funeral pile prepare,
  and bid the forests fall   such rites are paid
  to heroes slumbering in eternal shade
  then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,
  let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire.
  he spoke  they hear him, and the word obey
  the rage of hunger and of thirst allay,
  then ease in sleep the labours of the day.
  but great pelides, stretch'd along the shore,
  where, dash'd on rocks, the broken billows roar,
  lies inly groaning  while on either hand
  the martial myrmidons confusedly stand.
  along the grass his languid members fall,
  tired with his chase around the trojan wall
  hush'd by the murmurs of the rolling deep,
  at length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.
  when lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,
  of sad patroclus rose, or seem'd to rise
  in the same robe he living wore, he came
  in stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.
  the form familiar hover'd o'er his head,
   and sleeps achilles?  thus the phantom said
  sleeps my achilles, his patroclus dead?
  living, i seem'd his dearest, tenderest care,
  but now forgot, i wander in the air.
  let my pale corse the rites of burial know,
  and give me entrance in the realms below
  till then the spirit finds no resting-place,
  but here and there the unbodied spectres chase
  the vagrant dead around the dark abode,
  forbid to cross the irremeable flood.
  now give thy hand  for to the farther shore
  when once we pass, the soul returns no more
  when once the last funereal flames ascend,
  no more shall meet achilles and his friend
  no more our thoughts to those we loved make known
  or quit the dearest, to converse alone.
  me fate has sever'd from the sons of earth,
  the fate fore-doom'd that waited from my birth
  thee too it waits  before the trojan wall
  even great and godlike thou art doom'd to fall.
  hear then  and as in fate and love we join,
  ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!
  together have we lived  together bred,
  one house received us, and one table fed
  that golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,
  may mix our ashes in one common grave.
   and is it thou?  he answers  to my sight
  once more return'st thou from the realms of night?
  o more than brother! think each office paid,
  whate'er can rest a discontented shade
  but grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!
  afford at least that melancholy joy.
  he said, and with his longing arms essay'd
  in vain to grasp the visionary shade!
  like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,
  and hears a feeble, lamentable cry.
  confused he wakes  amazement breaks the bands
  of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,
  pensive he muses with uplifted hands
   'tis true, 'tis certain  man, though dead, retains
  part of himself  the immortal mind remains
  the form subsists without the body's aid,
  aerial semblance, and an empty shade!
  this night my friend, so late in battle lost,
  stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost
  even now familiar, as in life, he came
  alas! how different! yet how like the same!
  thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears
  and now the rosy-finger'd morn appears,
  shows every mournful face with tears o'erspread,
  and glares on the pale visage of the dead.
  but agamemnon, as the rites demand,
  with mules and waggons sends a chosen band
  to load the timber, and the pile to rear
  a charge consign'd to merion's faithful care.
  with proper instruments they take the road,
  axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.
  first march the heavy mules, securely slow,
  o'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go
  jumping, high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground,
  rattle the clattering cars, and the shock'd axles bound
  but when arrived at ida's spreading woods,
   fair ida, water'd with descending floods,
  loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes
  on all sides round the forest hurls her oaks
  headlong. deep echoing groan the thickets brown
  then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.
  the wood the grecians cleave, prepared to burn
  and the slow mules the same rough road return
  the sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore
   such charge was given them  to the sandy shore
  there on the spot which great achilles show'd,
  they eased their shoulders, and disposed the load
  circling around the place, where times to come
  shall view patroclus' and achilles' tomb.
  the hero bids his martial troops appear
  high on their cars in all the pomp of war
  each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,
  all mount their chariots, combatants and squires.
  the chariots first proceed, a shining train
  then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain
  next these the melancholy band appear
  amidst, lay dead patroclus on the bier
  o'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw
  achilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe,
  supporting with his hands the hero's head,
  bends o'er the extended body of the dead.
  patroclus decent on the appointed ground
  they place, and heap the sylvan pile around.
  but great achilles stands apart in prayer,
  and from his head divides the yellow hair
  those curling locks which from his youth he vow'd,
  and sacred grew, to sperchius' honour'd flood
  then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,
  and roll'd his eyes around the watery waste
   sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost
  delightful roll along my native coast!
  to whom we vainly vow'd, at our return,
  these locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn
  full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,
  where to the day thy silver fountains rise,
  and where in shade of consecrated bowers
  thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!
  so vow'd my father, but he vow'd in vain
  no more achilles sees his native plain
  in that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,
  patroclus bears them to the shades below.
  thus o'er patroclus while the hero pray'd,
  on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.
  once more afresh the grecian sorrows flow
  and now the sun had set upon their woe
  but to the king of men thus spoke the chief
   enough, atrides! give the troops relief
  permit the mourning legions to retire,
  and let the chiefs alone attend the pyre
  the pious care be ours, the dead to burn--
  he said  the people to their ships return
  while those deputed to inter the slain
  heap with a rising pyramid the plain.
  a hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,
  the growing structure spreads on every side
  high on the top the manly corse they lay,
  and well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay
  achilles covered with their fat the dead,
  and the piled victims round the body spread
  then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,
  suspends around, low-bending o'er the pile.
  four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan
  pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.
  of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,
  fall two, selected to attend their lord,
  then last of all, and horrible to tell,
  sad sacrifice! twelve trojan captives fell.
  on these the rage of fire victorious preys,
  involves and joins them in one common blaze.
  smear'd with the bloody rites, he stands on high,
  and calls the spirit with a dreadful cry
   all hail, patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost
  hear, and exult, on pluto's dreary coast.
  behold achilles' promise fully paid,
  twelve trojan heroes offer'd to thy shade
  but heavier fates on hector's corse attend,
  saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.
  so spake he, threatening  but the gods made vain
  his threat, and guard inviolate the slain
  celestial venus hover'd o'er his head,
  and roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed
  she watch'd him all the night and all the day,
  and drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.
  nor sacred phoebus less employ'd his care
  he pour'd around a veil of gather'd air,
  and kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,
  against the solar beam and sirian fire.
  nor yet the pile, where dead patroclus lies,
  smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise
  but, fast beside, achilles stood in prayer,
  invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,
  and victims promised, and libations cast,
  to gentle zephyr and the boreal blast
  he call'd the aerial powers, along the skies
  to breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.
  the winged iris heard the hero's call,
  and instant hasten'd to their airy hall,
  where in old zephyr's open courts on high,
  sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.
  she shone amidst them, on her painted bow
  the rocky pavement glitter'd with the show.
  all from the banquet rise, and each invites
  the various goddess to partake the rites.
   not so  the dame replied , i haste to go
  to sacred ocean, and the floods below
  even now our solemn hecatombs attend,
  and heaven is feasting on the world's green end
  with righteous ethiops  uncorrupted train!
  far on the extremest limits of the main.
  but peleus' son entreats, with sacrifice,
  the western spirit, and the north, to rise!
  let on patroclus' pile your blast be driven,
  and bear the blazing honours high to heaven.
  swift as the word she vanish'd from their view
  swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew
  forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,
  and heaps on heaps the clouds are toss'd before.
  to the wide main then stooping from the skies,
  the heaving deeps in watery mountains rise
  troy feels the blast along her shaking walls,
  till on the pile the gather'd tempest falls.
  the structure crackles in the roaring fires,
  and all the night the plenteous flame aspires.
  all night achilles hails patroclus' soul,
  with large libations from the golden bowl.
  as a poor father, helpless and undone,
  mourns o'er the ashes of an only son,
  takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,
  and pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn
  so stay'd achilles, circling round the shore,
  so watch'd the flames, till now they flame no more.
  'twas when, emerging through the shades of night.
  the morning planet told the approach of light
  and, fast behind, aurora's warmer ray
  o'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day
  then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd,
  and to their caves the whistling winds return'd
  across the thracian seas their course they bore
  the ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.
  then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,
  and sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,
  exhausted with his grief  meanwhile the crowd
  of thronging grecians round achilles stood
  the tumult waked him  from his eyes he shook
  unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke
   ye kings and princes of the achaian name!
  first let us quench the yet remaining flame
  with sable wine  then, as the rites direct,
  the hero's bones with careful view select
   apart, and easy to be known they lie
  amidst the heap, and obvious to the eye
  the rest around the margin will be seen
  promiscuous, steeds and immolated men
  these wrapp'd in double cauls of fat, prepare
  and in the golden vase dispose with care
  there let them rest with decent honour laid,
  till i shall follow to the infernal shade.
  meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,
  a common structure on the humble sands
  hereafter greece some nobler work may raise,
  and late posterity record our praise!
  the greeks obey  where yet the embers glow,
  wide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw,
  and deep subsides the ashy heap below.
  next the white bones his sad companions place,
  with tears collected, in the golden vase.
  the sacred relics to the tent they bore
  the urn a veil of linen covered o'er.
  that done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,
  and cast the deep foundations round the pyre
  high in the midst they heap the swelling bed
  of rising earth, memorial of the dead.
  the swarming populace the chief detains,
  and leads amidst a wide extent of plains
  there placed them round  then from the ships proceeds
  a train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,
  vases and tripods  for the funeral games ,
  resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.
  first stood the prizes to reward the force
  of rapid racers in the dusty course
  a woman for the first, in beauty's bloom,
  skill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom
  and a large vase, where two bright handles rise,
  of twenty measures its capacious size.
  the second victor claims a mare unbroke,
  big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke
  the third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame
  four ample measures held the shining frame
  two golden talents for the fourth were placed
  an ample double bowl contents the last.
  these in fair order ranged upon the plain,
  the hero, rising, thus address'd the train
   behold the prizes, valiant greeks! decreed
  to the brave rulers of the racing steed
  prizes which none beside ourself could gain,
  should our immortal coursers take the plain
   a race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god
  peleus received, and on his son bestow'd.
  but this no time our vigour to display
  nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day
  lost is patroclus now, that wont to deck
  their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.
  sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,
  and trail those graceful honours on the sand!
  let others for the noble task prepare,
  who trust the courser and the flying car.
  fired at his word the rival racers rise
  but far the first eumelus hopes the prize,
  famed though pieria for the fleetest breed,
  and skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed.
  with equal ardour bold tydides swell'd,
  the steeds of tros beneath his yoke compell'd
   which late obey'd the dardan chiefs command,
  when scarce a god redeem'd him from his hand .
  then menelaus his podargus brings,
  and the famed courser of the king of kings
  whom rich echepolus  more rich than brave ,
  to 'scape the wars, to agamemnon gave,
    the her name  at home to end his days
  base wealth preferring to eternal praise.
  next him antilochus demands the course
  with beating heart, and cheers his pylian horse.
  experienced nestor gives his son the reins,
  directs his judgment, and his heat restrains
  nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears
  the prudent son with unattending ears.
   my son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,
  the gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless'd
  neptune and jove on thee conferr'd the skill
  swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.
  to guide thy conduct little precept needs
  but slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.
  fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known
  compare those rivals' judgment and thy own
  it is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,
  and to be swift is less than to be wise.
  'tis more by art than force of numerous strokes
  the dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks
  by art the pilot, through the boiling deep
  and howling tempest, steers the fearless ship
  and 'tis the artist wins the glorious course
  not those who trust in chariots and in horse.
  in vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,
  and short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive
  while with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,
  the knowing racer to his end proceeds
  fix'd on the goal his eye foreruns the course,
  his hand unerring steers the steady horse,
  and now contracts, or now extends the rein,
  observing still the foremost on the plain.
  mark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found
  yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground
  of some once stately oak the last remains,
  or hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains
  inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar
  and round, a circle for the wheeling car.
   some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace
  or then, as now, the limit of a race.
  bear close to this, and warily proceed,
  a little bending to the left-hand steed
  but urge the right, and give him all the reins
  while thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,
  and turns him short  till, doubling as they roll,
  the wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.
  yet  not to break the car, or lame the horse
  clear of the stony heap direct the course
  lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be
  a joy to others, a reproach to me.
  so shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,
  and leave unskilful swiftness far behind
  though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed
  which bore adrastus, of celestial breed
  or the famed race, through all the regions known,
  that whirl'd the car of proud laomedon.
  thus  nought unsaid  the much-advising sage
  concludes  then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.
  next bold meriones was seen to rise,
  the last, but not least ardent for the prize.
  they mount their seats  the lots their place dispose
   roll'd in his helmet, these achilles throws .
  young nestor leads the race  eumelus then
  and next the brother of the king of men
  thy lot, meriones, the fourth was cast
  and, far the bravest, diomed, was last.
  they stand in order, an impatient train
  pelides points the barrier on the plain,
  and sends before old phoenix to the place,
  to mark the racers, and to judge the race.
  at once the coursers from the barrier bound
  the lifted scourges all at once resound
  their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before
  and up the champaign thunder from the shore
  thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,
  and the lost courser in the whirlwind flies
  loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,
  float in their speed, and dance upon the wind
  the smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,
  now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.
  while hot for fame, and conquest all their care,
   each o'er his flying courser hung in air,
  erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,
  they pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.
  now  the last compass fetch'd around the goal
  at the near prize each gathers all his soul,
  each burns with double hope, with double pain,
  tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.
  first flew eumelus on pheretian steeds
  with those of tros bold diomed succeeds
  close on eumelus' back they puff the wind,
  and seem just mounting on his car behind
  full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,
  and, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.
  then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize
  but angry phoebus to tydides flies,
  strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain
  his matchless horses' labour on the plain.
  rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey
  snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.
  the fraud celestial pallas sees with pain,
  springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,
  and fills his steeds with vigour. at a stroke
  she breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke
  no more their way the startled horses held
  the car reversed came rattling on the field
  shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,
  prone on the dust the unhappy master fell
  his batter'd face and elbows strike the ground
  nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound
  grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes
  before him far the glad tydides flies
  minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,
  and crowns him victor of the labour'd race.
  the next, though distant, menelaus succeeds
  while thus young nestor animates his steeds
   now, now, my generous pair, exert your force
  not that we hope to match tydides' horse,
  since great minerva wings their rapid way,
  and gives their lord the honours of the day
  but reach atrides! shall his mare outgo
  your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?
  through your neglect, if lagging on the plain
  the last ignoble gift be all we gain,
  no more shall nestor's hand your food supply,
  the old man's fury rises, and ye die.
  haste then  yon narrow road, before our sight,
  presents the occasion, could we use it right.
  thus he. the coursers at their master's threat
  with quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.
  and now antilochus with nice survey
  observes the compass of the hollow way.
  'twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,
  fast by the road a precipice was worn
  here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng
  the spartan hero's chariot smoked along.
  close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,
  still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.
  atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,
  and wonders at the rashness of his foe.
   hold, stay your steeds--what madness thus to ride
  this narrow way! take larger field  he cried ,
  or both must fall. --atrides cried in vain
  he flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.
  far as an able arm the disk can send,
  when youthful rivals their full force extend,
  so far, antilochus! thy chariot flew
  before the king  he, cautious, backward drew
  his horse compell'd  foreboding in his fears
  the rattling ruin of the clashing cars,
  the floundering coursers rolling on the plain,
  and conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.
  but thus upbraids his rival as he flies
   go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!
  go, but expect not i'll the prize resign
  add perjury to fraud, and make it thine--
  then to his steeds with all his force he cries,
   be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!
  your rivals, destitute of youthful force,
  with fainting knees shall labour in the course,
  and yield the glory yours. --the steeds obey
  already at their heels they wing their way,
  and seem already to retrieve the day.
  meantime the grecians in a ring beheld
  the coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.
  the first who mark'd them was the cretan king
  high on a rising ground, above the ring,
  the monarch sat  from whence with sure survey
  he well observed the chief who led the way,
  and heard from far his animating cries,
  and saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes
  on whose broad front a blaze of shining white,
  like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.
  he saw  and rising, to the greeks begun
   are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?
  or can ye, all, another chief survey,
  and other steeds than lately led the way?
  those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,
  lie sure disabled in the middle field
  for, since the goal they doubled, round the plain
  i search to find them, but i search in vain.
  perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,
  and, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,
  shot from the chariot  while his coursers stray
  with frantic fury from the destined way.
  rise then some other, and inform my sight,
  for these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right
  yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,
  the great  tolian chief, renown'd in war.
   old man!  oileus rashly thus replies
  thy tongue too hastily confers the prize
  of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,
  nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.
  eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,
  still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race
  i well discern him, as he shakes the rein,
  and hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain.
  thus he. idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd
   barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!
  contentious prince, of all the greeks beside
  the last in merit, as the first in pride!
  to vile reproach what answer can we make?
  a goblet or a tripod let us stake,
  and be the king the judge. the most unwise
  will learn their rashness, when they pay the price.
  he said  and ajax, by mad passion borne,
  stern had replied  fierce scorn enhancing scorn
  to fell extremes. but thetis' godlike son
  awful amidst them rose, and thus begun
   forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend
  much would ye blame, should others thus offend
  and lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.
  no sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,
  drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.
  high o'er his head the circling lash he wields
  his bounding horses scarcely touch the fields
  his car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,
  bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,
  refulgent through the cloud  no eye could find
  the track his flying wheels had left behind
  and the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace
  so swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.
  now victor at the goal tydides stands,
  quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands
  from the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream
  the well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam
  with joy brave sthenelus receives the prize,
  the tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes
  these to the ships his train triumphant leads,
  the chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.
  young nestor follows  who by art, not force,
  o'erpass'd atrides  second in the course.
  behind, atrides urged the race, more near
  than to the courser in his swift career
  the following car, just touching with his heel
  and brushing with his tail the whirling wheel
  such, and so narrow now the space between
  the rivals, late so distant on the green
  so soon swift  the her lost ground regain'd,
  one length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.
  merion pursued, at greater distance still,
  with tardier coursers, and inferior skill.
  last came, admetus! thy unhappy son
  slow dragged the steeds his batter'd chariot on
  achilles saw, and pitying thus begun
   behold! the man whose matchless art surpass'd
  the sons of greece! the ablest, yet the last!
  fortune denies, but justice bids us pay
   since great tydides bears the first away
  to him the second honours of the day.
  the greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,
  and then eumelus had received the prize,
  but youthful nestor, jealous of his fame,
  the award opposes, and asserts his claim.
   think not  he cries  i tamely will resign,
  o peleus' son! the mare so justly mine.
  what if the gods, the skilful to confound,
  have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?
  perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,
  and vows omitted forfeited the prize.
  if yet  distinction to thy friend to show,
  and please a soul desirous to bestow
  some gift must grace eumelus, view thy store
  of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore
  an ample present let him thence receive,
  and greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.
  but this my prize i never shall forego
  this, who but touches, warriors! is my foe.
  thus spake the youth  nor did his words offend
  pleased with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend,
  achilles smiled   the gift proposed  he cried ,
  antilochus! we shall ourself provide.
  with plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er,
   the same renown'd asteropaeus wore,
  whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,
   no vulgar gift,  eumelus! shall be thine.
  he said  automedon at his command
  the corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.
  distinguish'd by his friend, his bosom glows
  with generous joy  then menelaus rose
  the herald placed the sceptre in his hands,
  and still'd the clamour of the shouting bands.
  not without cause incensed at nestor's son,
  and inly grieving, thus the king begun
   the praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd,
  an act so rash, antilochus! has stain'd.
  robb'd of my glory and my just reward,
  to you, o grecians! be my wrong declared
  so not a leader shall our conduct blame,
  or judge me envious of a rival's fame.
  but shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?
  what needs appealing in a fact so plain?
  what greek shall blame me, if i bid thee rise,
  and vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize?
  rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,
  the driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand
  and touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent
  was but to conquer, not to circumvent.
  swear by that god whose liquid arms surround
  the globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!
  the prudent chief with calm attention heard
  then mildly thus   excuse, if youth have err'd
  superior as thou art, forgive the offence,
  nor i thy equal, or in years, or sense.
  thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age,
  weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.
  the prize i quit, if thou thy wrath resign
  the mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine
  ere i become  from thy dear friendship torn
  hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn.
  so spoke antilochus  and at the word
  the mare contested to the king restored.
  joy swells his soul  as when the vernal grain
  lifts the green ear above the springing plain,
  the fields their vegetable life renew,
  and laugh and glitter with the morning dew
  such joy the spartan's shining face o'erspread,
  and lifted his gay heart, while thus he said
   still may our souls, o generous youth! agree
  'tis now atrides' turn to yield to thee.
  rash heat perhaps a moment might control,
  not break, the settled temper of thy soul.
  not but  my friend  'tis still the wiser way
  to waive contention with superior sway
  for ah! how few, who should like thee offend,
  like thee, have talents to regain the friend!
  to plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,
  suffice thy father's merit and thy own
  generous alike, for me, the sire and son
  have greatly suffer'd, and have greatly done.
  i yield  that all may know, my soul can bend,
  nor is my pride preferr'd before my friend.
  he said  and pleased his passion to command,
  resign'd the courser to noemon's hand,
  friend of the youthful chief  himself content,
  the shining charger to his vessel sent.
  the golden talents merion next obtain'd
  the fifth reward, the double bowl, remain'd.
  achilles this to reverend nestor bears.
  and thus the purpose of his gift declares
   accept thou this, o sacred sire!  he said
  in dear memorial of patroclus dead
  dead and for ever lost patroclus lies,
  for ever snatch'd from our desiring eyes!
  take thou this token of a grateful heart,
  though 'tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,
  the quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,
  or urge the race, or wrestle on the field
  thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,
  but left the glory of the past thy own.
  he said, and placed the goblet at his side
  with joy the venerable king replied
   wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved
  a senior honour'd, and a friend beloved!
  too true it is, deserted of my strength,
  these wither'd arms and limbs have fail'd at length.
  oh! had i now that force i felt of yore,
  known through buprasium and the pylian shore!
  victorious then in every solemn game,
  ordain'd to amarynces' mighty name
  the brave epeians gave my glory way,
   tolians, pylians, all resign'd the day.
  i quell'd clytomedes in fights of hand,
  and backward hurl'd ancaeus on the sand,
  surpass'd iphyclus in the swift career,
  phyleus and polydorus with the spear.
  the sons of actor won the prize of horse,
  but won by numbers, not by art or force
  for the famed twins, impatient to survey
  prize after prize by nestor borne away,
  sprung to their car  and with united pains
  one lash'd the coursers, while one ruled the reins.
  such once i was! now to these tasks succeeds
  a younger race, that emulate our deeds
  i yield, alas!  to age who must not yield?
  though once the foremost hero of the field.
  go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,
  with martial honours decorate the dead
  while pleased i take the gift thy hands present,
   pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,
  rejoiced, of all the numerous greeks, to see
  not one but honours sacred age and me
  those due distinctions thou so well canst pay,
  may the just gods return another day!
  proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days
  achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.
  the prizes next are order'd to the field,
  for the bold champions who the caestus wield.
  a stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,
  of six years' age, unconscious of the yoke,
  is to the circus led, and firmly bound
  next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.
  achilles rising, thus   let greece excite
  two heroes equal to this hardy fight
  who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,
  and rush beneath the long-descending stroke.
  on whom apollo shall the palm bestow,
  and whom the greeks supreme by conquest know,
  this mule his dauntless labours shall repay,
  the vanquish'd bear the massy bowl away.
  this dreadful combat great epeus chose
  high o'er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,
  and seized the beast, and thus began to say
   stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!
   price of his ruin  for who dares deny
  this mule my right  the undoubted victor i
  others, 'tis own'd, in fields of battle shine,
  but the first honours of this fight are mine
  for who excels in all? then let my foe
  draw near, but first his certain fortune know
  secure this hand shall his whole frame confound,
  mash all his bones, and all his body pound
  so let his friends be nigh, a needful train,
  to heave the batter'd carcase off the plain.
  the giant spoke  and in a stupid gaze
  the host beheld him, silent with amaze!
  'twas thou, euryalus! who durst aspire
  to meet his might, and emulate thy sire,
  the great mecistheus  who in days of yore
  in theban games the noblest trophy bore,
   the games ordain'd dead oedipus to grace,
  and singly vanquish the cadmean race.
  him great tydides urges to contend,
  warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend
  officious with the cincture girds him round
  and to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.
  amid the circle now each champion stands,
  and poises high in air his iron hands
  with clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,
  their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,
  and painful sweat from all their members flows.
  at length epeus dealt a weighty blow
  full on the cheek of his unwary foe
  beneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway
  down dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.
  as a large fish, when winds and waters roar,
  by some huge billow dash'd against the shore,
  lies panting  not less batter'd with his wound,
  the bleeding hero pants upon the ground.
  to rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,
  scornful, his hand  and gives him to his friends
  whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,
  and dragging his disabled legs along
  nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o'er
  his mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore
  wrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought
  his friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.
  the third bold game achilles next demands,
  and calls the wrestlers to the level sands
  a massy tripod for the victor lies,
  of twice six oxen its reputed price
  and next, the loser's spirits to restore,
  a female captive, valued but at four.
  scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop
  when tower-like ajax and ulysses rose.
  amid the ring each nervous rival stands,
  embracing rigid with implicit hands.
  close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd
  below, their planted feet at distance fix'd
  like two strong rafters which the builder forms,
  proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,
  their tops connected, but at wider space
  fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.
  now to the grasp each manly body bends
  the humid sweat from every pore descends
  their bones resound with blows  sides, shoulders, thighs
  swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.
  nor could ulysses, for his art renown'd,
  o'erturn the strength of ajax on the ground
  nor could the strength of ajax overthrow
  the watchful caution of his artful foe.
  while the long strife even tired the lookers on,
  thus to ulysses spoke great telamon
   or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me
  prove we our force, and jove the rest decree.
  he said  and, straining, heaved him off the ground
  with matchless strength  that time ulysses found
  the strength to evade, and where the nerves combine
  his ankle struck  the giant fell supine
  ulysses, following, on his bosom lies
  shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.
  ajax to lift ulysses next essays
  he barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise
  his knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied
  and grappling close, they tumbled side by side.
  defiled with honourable dust they roll,
  still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul
  again they rage, again to combat rise
  when great achilles thus divides the prize
   your noble vigour, o my friends, restrain
  nor weary out your generous strength in vain.
  ye both have won  let others who excel,
  now prove that prowess you have proved so well.
  the hero's words the willing chiefs obey,
  from their tired bodies wipe the dust away,
  and, clothed anew, the following games survey.
  and now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace
  the youths contending in the rapid race
  a silver urn that full six measures held,
  by none in weight or workmanship excell'd
  sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,
  elaborate, with artifice divine
  whence tyrian sailors did the prize transport,
  and gave to thoas at the lemnian port
  from him descended, good eunaeus heir'd
  the glorious gift  and, for lycaon spared,
  to brave patroclus gave the rich reward
  now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,
  it stands the prize of swiftness in the race.
  a well-fed ox was for the second placed
  and half a talent must content the last.
  achilles rising then bespoke the train
   who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,
  stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.
  the hero said, and starting from his place,
  oilean ajax rises to the race
  ulysses next  and he whose speed surpass'd
  his youthful equals, nestor's son, the last.
  ranged in a line the ready racers stand
  pelides points the barrier with his hand
  all start at once  oileus led the race
  the next ulysses, measuring pace with pace
  behind him, diligently close, he sped,
  as closely following as the running thread
  the spindle follows, and displays the charms
  of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms
  graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,
  and treads each footstep ere the dust can rise
  his glowing breath upon his shoulders plays
  the admiring greeks loud acclamations raise
  to him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,
  and send their souls before him as he flies.
  now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,
  the panting chief to pallas lifts his soul
   assist, o goddess!  thus in thought he pray'd!
  and present at his thought descends the maid.
  buoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,
  and feels a pinion lifting every limb.
  all fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,
  unhappy ajax stumbles on the plain
   o'erturn'd by pallas , where the slippery shore
  was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.
   the self-same place beside patroclus' pyre,
  where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.
  besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,
  obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay
  the well-fed bull  the second prize  he shared,
  and left the urn ulysses' rich reward.
  then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,
  the baffled hero thus the greeks address'd
   accursed fate! the conquest i forego
  a mortal i, a goddess was my foe
  she urged her favourite on the rapid way,
  and pallas, not ulysses, won the day.
  thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore
  a burst of laughter echoed through the shore.
  antilochus, more humorous than the rest,
  takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest
   why with our wiser elders should we strive?
  the gods still love them, and they always thrive.
  ye see, to ajax i must yield the prize
  he to ulysses, still more aged and wise
   a green old age unconscious of decays,
  that proves the hero born in better days!
  behold his vigour in this active race!
  achilles only boasts a swifter pace
  for who can match achilles? he who can,
  must yet be more than hero, more than man.
  the effect succeeds the speech. pelides cries,
   thy artful praise deserves a better prize.
  nor greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd
  receive a talent of the purest gold.
  the youth departs content. the host admire
  the son of nestor, worthy of his sire.
  next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings
  cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings
  arms which of late divine sarpedon wore,
  and great patroclus in short triumph bore.
   stand forth the bravest of our host!  he cries
  whoever dares deserve so rich a prize,
  now grace the lists before our army's sight,
  and sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.
  who first the jointed armour shall explore,
  and stain his rival's mail with issuing gore,
  the sword asteropaeus possess'd of old,
   a thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,
  shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side
  these arms in common let the chiefs divide
  for each brave champion, when the combat ends,
  a sumptuous banquet at our tents attends.
  fierce at the word uprose great tydeus' son,
  and the huge bulk of ajax telamon.
  clad in refulgent steel, on either hand,
  the dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand
  louring they meet, tremendous to the sight
  each argive bosom beats with fierce delight.
  opposed in arms not long they idly stood,
  but thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.
  a furious pass the spear of ajax made
  through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.
  not thus the foe  his javelin aim'd above
  the buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.
  but greece, now trembling for her hero's life,
  bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.
  yet still the victor's due tydides gains,
  with him the sword and studded belt remains.
  then hurl'd the hero, thundering on the ground,
  a mass of iron  an enormous round ,
  whose weight and size the circling greeks admire,
  rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.
  this mighty quoit aetion wont to rear,
  and from his whirling arm dismiss in air
  the giant by achilles slain, he stow'd
  among his spoils this memorable load.
  for this, he bids those nervous artists vie,
  that teach the disk to sound along the sky.
   let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise
  who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize
  if he be one enrich'd with large domain
  of downs for flocks, and arable for grain,
  small stock of iron needs that man provide
  his hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied
  from hence  nor ask the neighbouring city's aid
  for ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade.
  stern polypoetes stepp'd before the throng,
  and great leonteus, more than mortal strong
  whose force with rival forces to oppose,
  uprose great ajax  up epeus rose.
  each stood in order  first epeus threw
  high o'er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.
  leonteus next a little space surpass'd
  and third, the strength of godlike ajax cast.
  o'er both their marks it flew  till fiercely flung
  from polypoetes' arm the discus sung
  far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,
  that distant falls among the grazing cows,
  so past them all the rapid circle flies
  his friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,
  with force conjoin'd heave off the weighty prize.
  those, who in skilful archery contend,
  he next invites the twanging bow to bend
  and twice ten axes casts amidst the round,
  ten double-edged, and ten that singly wound
  the mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,
  the hero fixes in the sandy shore
  to the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,
  the trembling mark at which their arrows fly.
   whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear
  these two-edged axes, terrible in war
  the single, he whose shaft divides the cord.
  he said  experienced merion took the word
  and skilful teucer  in the helm they threw
  their lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.
  swift from the string the sounding arrow flies
  but flies unbless'd! no grateful sacrifice,
  no firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow
  to phoebus, patron of the shaft and bow.
  for this, thy well-aim'd arrow turn'd aside,
  err'd from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied
  adown the mainmast fell the parted string,
  and the free bird to heaven displays her wing
  sea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,
  and merion eager meditates the wound
  he takes the bow, directs the shaft above,
  and following with his eye the soaring dove,
  implores the god to speed it through the skies,
  with vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrific
  the dove, in airy circles as she wheels,
  amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels
  quite through and through the point its passage found,
  and at his feet fell bloody to the ground.
  the wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,
  with flagging wings alighted on the mast,
  a moment hung, and spread her pinions there,
  then sudden dropp'd, and left her life in air.
  from the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,
  and to the ships brave merion bears the prize.
  to close the funeral games, achilles last
  a massy spear amid the circle placed,
  and ample charger of unsullied frame,
  with flowers high-wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame.
  for these he bids the heroes prove their art,
  whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.
  here too great merion hopes the noble prize
  nor here disdain'd the king of men to rise.
  with joy pelides saw the honour paid,
  rose to the monarch, and respectful said
   thee first in virtue, as in power supreme,
  o king of nations! all thy greeks proclaim
  in every martial game thy worth attest,
  and know thee both their greatest and their best.
  take then the prize, but let brave merion bear
  this beamy javelin in thy brother's war.
  pleased from the hero's lips his praise to hear,
  the king to merion gives the brazen spear
  but, set apart for sacred use, commands
  the glittering charger to talthybius' hands.
  now from the finish'd games the grecian band
  seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,
  all stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share,
  and pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.
  not so achilles  he, to grief resign'd,
  his friend's dear image present to his mind,
  takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep
  nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.
  restless he roll'd around his weary bed,
  and all his soul on his patroclus fed
  the form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,
  that youthful vigour, and that manly mind,
  what toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,
  what seas they measured, and what fields they fought
  all pass'd before him in remembrance dear,
  thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.
  and now supine, now prone, the hero lay,
  now shifts his side, impatient for the day
  then starting up, disconsolate he goes
  wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.
  there as the solitary mourner raves,
  the ruddy morning rises o'er the waves
  soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join'd!
  the chariot flies, and hector trails behind.
  and thrice, patroclus! round thy monument
  was hector dragg'd, then hurried to the tent.
  there sleep at last o'ercomes the hero's eyes
  while foul in dust the unhonour'd carcase lies,
  but not deserted by the pitying skies
  for phoebus watch'd it with superior care,
  preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air
  and, ignominious as it swept the field,
  spread o'er the sacred corse his golden shield.
  all heaven was moved, and hermes will'd to go
  by stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe
  but neptune this, and pallas this denies,
  and th' unrelenting empress of the skies,
  e'er since that day implacable to troy,
  what time young paris, simple shepherd boy,
  won by destructive lust  reward obscene ,
  their charms rejected for the cyprian queen.
  but when the tenth celestial morning broke,
  to heaven assembled, thus apollo spoke
   unpitying powers! how oft each holy fane
  has hector tinged with blood of victims slain?
  and can ye still his cold remains pursue?
  still grudge his body to the trojans' view?
  deny to consort, mother, son, and sire,
  the last sad honours of a funeral fire?
  is then the dire achilles all your care?
  that iron heart, inflexibly severe
  a lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,
  in strength of rage, and impotence of pride
  who hastes to murder with a savage joy,
  invades around, and breathes but to destroy!
  shame is not of his soul  nor understood,
  the greatest evil and the greatest good.
  still for one loss he rages unresign'd,
  repugnant to the lot of all mankind
  to lose a friend, a brother, or a son,
  heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done
  awhile they sorrow, then dismiss their care
  fate gives the wound, and man is born to bear.
  but this insatiate, the commission given
  by fate exceeds, and tempts the wrath of heaven
  lo, how his rage dishonest drags along
  hector's dead earth, insensible of wrong!
  brave though he be, yet by no reason awed,
  he violates the laws of man and god.
   if equal honours by the partial skies
  are doom'd both heroes,  juno thus replies,
  if thetis' son must no distinction know,
  then hear, ye gods! the patron of the bow.
  but hector only boasts a mortal claim,
  his birth deriving from a mortal dame
  achilles, of your own ethereal race,
  springs from a goddess by a man's embrace
   a goddess by ourself to peleus given,
  a man divine, and chosen friend of heaven
  to grace those nuptials, from the bright abode
  yourselves were present  where this minstrel-god,
  well pleased to share the feast, amid the quire
  stood proud to hymn, and tune his youthful lyre.
  then thus the thunderer checks the imperial dame
   let not thy wrath the court of heaven inflame
  their merits, nor their honours, are the same.
  but mine, and every god's peculiar grace
  hector deserves, of all the trojan race
  still on our shrines his grateful offerings lay,
   the only honours men to gods can pay,
  nor ever from our smoking altar ceased
  the pure libation, and the holy feast
  howe'er by stealth to snatch the corse away,
  we will not  thetis guards it night and day.
  but haste, and summon to our courts above
  the azure queen  let her persuasion move
  her furious son from priam to receive
  the proffer'd ransom, and the corse to leave.
  he added not  and iris from the skies,
  swift as a whirlwind, on the message flies,
  meteorous the face of ocean sweeps,
  refulgent gliding o'er the sable deeps.
  between where samos wide his forests spreads,
  and rocky imbrus lifts its pointed heads,
  down plunged the maid   the parted waves resound
  she plunged and instant shot the dark profound.
  as bearing death in the fallacious bait,
  from the bent angle sinks the leaden weight
  so pass'd the goddess through the closing wave,
  where thetis sorrow'd in her secret cave
  there placed amidst her melancholy train
   the blue-hair'd sisters of the sacred main
  pensive she sat, revolving fates to come,
  and wept her godlike son's approaching doom.
  then thus the goddess of the painted bow
   arise, o thetis! from thy seats below,
  'tis jove that calls. -- and why  the dame replies
  calls jove his thetis to the hated skies?
  sad object as i am for heavenly sight!
  ah may my sorrows ever shun the light!
  howe'er, be heaven's almighty sire obey'd--
  she spake, and veil'd her head in sable shade,
  which, flowing long, her graceful person clad
  and forth she paced, majestically sad.
  then through the world of waters they repair
   the way fair iris led  to upper air.
  the deeps dividing, o'er the coast they rise,
  and touch with momentary flight the skies.
  there in the lightning's blaze the sire they found,
  and all the gods in shining synod round.
  thetis approach'd with anguish in her face,
   minerva rising, gave the mourner place,
  even juno sought her sorrows to console,
  and offer'd from her hand the nectar-bowl
  she tasted, and resign'd it  then began
  the sacred sire of gods and mortal man
   thou comest, fair thetis, but with grief o'ercast
  maternal sorrows  long, ah, long to last!
  suffice, we know and we partake thy cares
  but yield to fate, and hear what jove declares
  nine days are past since all the court above
  in hector's cause have moved the ear of jove
  'twas voted, hermes from his godlike foe
  by stealth should bear him, but we will'd not so
  we will, thy son himself the corse restore,
  and to his conquest add this glory more.
  then hie thee to him, and our mandate bear
  tell him he tempts the wrath of heaven too far
  nor let him more  our anger if he dread
  vent his mad vengeance on the sacred dead
  but yield to ransom and the father's prayer
  the mournful father, iris shall prepare
  with gifts to sue  and offer to his hands
  whate'er his honour asks, or heart demands.
  his word the silver-footed queen attends,
  and from olympus' snowy tops descends.
  arrived, she heard the voice of loud lament,
  and echoing groans that shook the lofty tent
  his friends prepare the victim, and dispose
  repast unheeded, while he vents his woes
  the goddess seats her by her pensive son,
  she press'd his hand, and tender thus begun
   how long, unhappy! shall thy sorrows flow,
  and thy heart waste with life-consuming woe
  mindless of food, or love, whose pleasing reign
  soothes weary life, and softens human pain?
  o snatch the moments yet within thy power
  not long to live, indulge the amorous hour!
  lo! jove himself  for jove's command i bear
  forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far.
  no longer then  his fury if thou dread
  detain the relics of great hector dead
  nor vent on senseless earth thy vengeance vain,
  but yield to ransom, and restore the slain.
  to whom achilles   be the ransom given,
  and we submit, since such the will of heaven.
  while thus they communed, from the olympian bowers
  jove orders iris to the trojan towers
   haste, winged goddess! to the sacred town,
  and urge her monarch to redeem his son.
  alone the ilian ramparts let him leave,
  and bear what stern achilles may receive
  alone, for so we will  no trojan near
  except, to place the dead with decent care,
  some aged herald, who with gentle hand
  may the slow mules and funeral car command.
  nor let him death, nor let him danger dread,
  safe through the foe by our protection led
  him hermes to achilles shall convey,
  guard of his life, and partner of his way.
  fierce as he is, achilles' self shall spare
  his age, nor touch one venerable hair
  some thought there must be in a soul so brave,
  some sense of duty, some desire to save.
  then down her bow the winged iris drives,
  and swift at priam's mournful court arrives
  where the sad sons beside their father's throne
  sat bathed in tears, and answer'd groan with groan.
  and all amidst them lay the hoary sire,
   sad scene of woe!  his face his wrapp'd attire
  conceal'd from sight  with frantic hands he spread
  a shower of ashes o'er his neck and head.
  from room to room his pensive daughters roam
  whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome
  mindful of those, who late their pride and joy,
  lie pale and breathless round the fields of troy!
  before the king jove's messenger appears,
  and thus in whispers greets his trembling ears
   fear not, o father! no ill news i bear
  from jove i come, jove makes thee still his care
  for hector's sake these walls he bids thee leave,
  and bear what stern achilles may receive
  alone, for so he wills  no trojan near,
  except, to place the dead with decent care,
  some aged herald, who with gentle hand
  may the slow mules and funeral car command.
  nor shalt thou death, nor shall thou danger dread
  safe through the foe by his protection led
  thee hermes to pelides shall convey,
  guard of thy life, and partner of thy way.
  fierce as he is, achilles' self shall spare
  thy age, nor touch one venerable hair
  some thought there must be in a soul so brave,
  some sense of duty, some desire to save.
  she spoke, and vanish'd. priam bids prepare
  his gentle mules and harness to the car
  there, for the gifts, a polish'd casket lay
  his pious sons the king's command obey.
  then pass'd the monarch to his bridal-room,
  where cedar-beams the lofty roofs perfume,
  and where the treasures of his empire lay
  then call'd his queen, and thus began to say
   unhappy consort of a king distress'd!
  partake the troubles of thy husband's breast
  i saw descend the messenger of jove,
  who bids me try achilles' mind to move
  forsake these ramparts, and with gifts obtain
  the corse of hector, at yon navy slain.
  tell me thy thought  my heart impels to go
  through hostile camps, and bears me to the foe.
  the hoary monarch thus. her piercing cries
  sad hecuba renews, and then replies
   ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?
  and where the prudence now that awed mankind?
  through phrygia once and foreign regions known
  now all confused, distracted, overthrown!
  singly to pass through hosts of foes! to face
   o heart of steel!  the murderer of thy race!
  to view that deathful eye, and wander o'er
  those hands yet red with hector's noble gore!
  alas! my lord! he knows not how to spare.
  and what his mercy, thy slain sons declare
  so brave! so many fallen! to claim his rage
  vain were thy dignity, and vain thy age.
  no--pent in this sad palace, let us give
  to grief the wretched days we have to live.
  still, still for hector let our sorrows flow,
  born to his own, and to his parents' woe!
  doom'd from the hour his luckless life begun,
  to dogs, to vultures, and to peleus' son!
  oh! in his dearest blood might i allay
  my rage, and these barbarities repay!
  for ah! could hector merit thus, whose breath
  expired not meanly, in unactive death?
  he poured his latest blood in manly fight,
  and fell a hero in his country's right.
   seek not to stay me, nor my soul affright
  with words of omen, like a bird of night,
   replied unmoved the venerable man
  'tis heaven commands me, and you urge in vain.
  had any mortal voice the injunction laid,
  nor augur, priest, nor seer, had been obey'd.
  a present goddess brought the high command,
  i saw, i heard her, and the word shall stand.
  i go, ye gods! obedient to your call
  if in yon camp your powers have doom'd my fall,
  content--by the same hand let me expire!
  add to the slaughter'd son the wretched sire!
  one cold embrace at least may be allow'd,
  and my last tears flow mingled with his blood!
  from forth his open'd stores, this said, he drew
  twelve costly carpets of refulgent hue,
  as many vests, as many mantles told,
  and twelve fair veils, and garments stiff with gold,
  two tripods next, and twice two chargers shine,
  with ten pure talents from the richest mine
  and last a large well-labour'd bowl had place,
   the pledge of treaties once with friendly thrace
  seem'd all too mean the stores he could employ,
  for one last look to buy him back to troy!
  lo! the sad father, frantic with his pain,
  around him furious drives his menial train
  in vain each slave with duteous care attends,
  each office hurts him, and each face offends.
   what make ye here, officious crowds!  he cries .
  hence! nor obtrude your anguish on my eyes.
  have ye no griefs at home, to fix ye there
  am i the only object of despair?
  am i become my people's common show,
  set up by jove your spectacle of woe?
  no, you must feel him too  yourselves must fall
  the same stern god to ruin gives you all
  nor is great hector lost by me alone
  your sole defence, your guardian power is gone!
  i see your blood the fields of phrygia drown,
  i see the ruins of your smoking town!
  o send me, gods! ere that sad day shall come,
  a willing ghost to pluto's dreary dome!
  he said, and feebly drives his friends away
  the sorrowing friends his frantic rage obey.
  next on his sons his erring fury falls,
  polites, paris, agathon, he calls
  his threats deiphobus and dius hear,
  hippothous, pammon, helenes the seer,
  and generous antiphon  for yet these nine
  survived, sad relics of his numerous line.
   inglorious sons of an unhappy sire!
  why did not all in hector's cause expire?
  wretch that i am! my bravest offspring slain.
  you, the disgrace of priam's house, remain!
  mestor the brave, renown'd in ranks of war,
  with troilus, dreadful on his rushing car,
  and last great hector, more than man divine,
  for sure he seem'd not of terrestrial line!
  all those relentless mars untimely slew,
  and left me these, a soft and servile crew,
  whose days the feast and wanton dance employ,
  gluttons and flatterers, the contempt of troy!
  why teach ye not my rapid wheels to run,
  and speed my journey to redeem my son?
  the sons their father's wretched age revere,
  forgive his anger, and produce the car.
  high on the seat the cabinet they bind
  the new-made car with solid beauty shined
  box was the yoke, emboss'd with costly pains,
  and hung with ringlets to receive the reins
  nine cubits long, the traces swept the ground
  these to the chariot's polish'd pole they bound.
  then fix'd a ring the running reins to guide,
  and close beneath the gather'd ends were tied.
  next with the gifts  the price of hector slain
  the sad attendants load the groaning wain
  last to the yoke the well-matched mules they bring,
   the gift of mysia to the trojan king.
  but the fair horses, long his darling care,
  himself received, and harness'd to his car
  grieved as he was, he not this task denied
  the hoary herald help'd him, at his side.
  while careful these the gentle coursers join'd,
  sad hecuba approach'd with anxious mind
  a golden bowl that foam'd with fragrant wine,
   libation destined to the power divine,
  held in her right, before the steed she stands,
  and thus consigns it to the monarch's hands
   take this, and pour to jove  that safe from harms
  his grace restore thee to our roof and arms.
  since victor of thy fears, and slighting mine,
  heaven, or thy soul, inspires this bold design
  pray to that god, who high on ida's brow
  surveys thy desolated realms below,
  his winged messenger to send from high,
  and lead thy way with heavenly augury
  let the strong sovereign of the plumy race
  tower on the right of yon ethereal space.
  that sign beheld, and strengthen'd from above,
  boldly pursue the journey mark'd by jove
  but if the god his augury denies,
  suppress thy impulse, nor reject advice.
   'tis just  said priam  to the sire above
  to raise our hands  for who so good as jove?
  he spoke, and bade the attendant handmaid bring
  the purest water of the living spring
   her ready hands the ewer and bason held
  then took the golden cup his queen had fill'd
  on the mid pavement pours the rosy wine,
  uplifts his eyes, and calls the power divine
   o first and greatest! heaven's imperial lord!
  on lofty ida's holy hill adored!
  to stern achilles now direct my ways,
  and teach him mercy when a father prays.
  if such thy will, despatch from yonder sky
  thy sacred bird, celestial augury!
  let the strong sovereign of the plumy race
  tower on the right of yon ethereal space
  so shall thy suppliant, strengthen'd from above,
  fearless pursue the journey mark'd by jove.
  jove heard his prayer, and from the throne on high,
  despatch'd his bird, celestial augury!
  the swift-wing'd chaser of the feather'd game,
  and known to gods by percnos' lofty name.
  wide as appears some palace-gate display'd.
  so broad, his pinions stretch'd their ample shade,
  as stooping dexter with resounding wings
  the imperial bird descends in airy rings.
  a dawn of joy in every face appears
  the mourning matron dries her timorous tears
  swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung
  the brazen portal in his passage rung
  the mules preceding draw the loaded wain,
  charged with the gifts  idaeus holds the rein
  the king himself his gentle steeds controls,
  and through surrounding friends the chariot rolls.
  on his slow wheels the following people wait,
  mourn at each step, and give him up to fate
  with hands uplifted eye him as he pass'd,
  and gaze upon him as they gazed their last.
  now forward fares the father on his way,
  through the lone fields, and back to ilion they.
  great jove beheld him as he cross'd the plain,
  and felt the woes of miserable man.
  then thus to hermes   thou whose constant cares
  still succour mortals, and attend their prayers
  behold an object to thy charge consign'd
  if ever pity touch'd thee for mankind,
  go, guard the sire  the observing foe prevent,
  and safe conduct him to achilles' tent.
  the god obeys, his golden pinions binds,
  and mounts incumbent on the wings of winds,
  that high, through fields of air, his flight sustain,
  o'er the wide earth, and o'er the boundless main
  then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,
  or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye
  thus arm'd, swift hermes steers his airy way,
  and stoops on hellespont's resounding sea.
  a beauteous youth, majestic and divine,
  he seem'd  fair offspring of some princely line!
  now twilight veil'd the glaring face of day,
  and clad the dusky fields in sober grey
  what time the herald and the hoary king
   their chariots stopping at the silver spring,
  that circling ilus' ancient marble flows
  allow'd their mules and steeds a short repose,
  through the dim shade the herald first espies
  a man's approach, and thus to priam cries
   i mark some foe's advance  o king! beware
  this hard adventure claims thy utmost care!
  for much i fear destruction hovers nigh
  our state asks counsel  is it best to fly?
  or old and helpless, at his feet to fall,
  two wretched suppliants, and for mercy call?
  the afflicted monarch shiver'd with despair
  pale grew his face, and upright stood his hair
  sunk was his heart  his colour went and came
  a sudden trembling shook his aged frame
  when hermes, greeting, touch'd his royal hand,
  and, gentle, thus accosts with kind demand
   say whither, father! when each mortal sight
  is seal'd in sleep, thou wanderest through the night?
  why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along,
  through grecian foes, so numerous and so strong?
  what couldst thou hope, should these thy treasures view
  these, who with endless hate thy race pursue?
  for what defence, alas! could'st thou provide
  thyself not young, a weak old man thy guide?
  yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread
  from me no harm shall touch thy reverend head
  from greece i'll guard thee too  for in those lines
  the living image of my father shines.
   thy words, that speak benevolence of mind,
  are true, my son!  the godlike sire rejoin'd
  great are my hazards  but the gods survey
  my steps, and send thee, guardian of my way.
  hail, and be bless'd! for scarce of mortal kind
  appear thy form, thy feature, and thy mind.
   nor true are all thy words, nor erring wide
   the sacred messenger of heaven replied
  but say, convey'st thou through the lonely plains
  what yet most precious of thy store remains,
  to lodge in safety with some friendly hand
  prepared, perchance, to leave thy native land?
  or fliest thou now?--what hopes can troy retain,
  thy matchless son, her guard and glory, slain?
  the king, alarm'd   say what, and whence thou art
  who search the sorrows of a parent's heart,
  and know so well how godlike hector died?
  thus priam spoke, and hermes thus replied
   you tempt me, father, and with pity touch
  on this sad subject you inquire too much.
  oft have these eyes that godlike hector view'd
  in glorious fight, with grecian blood embrued
  i saw him when, like jove, his flames he toss'd
  on thousand ships, and wither'd half a host
  i saw, but help'd not  stern achilles' ire
  forbade assistance, and enjoy'd the fire.
  for him i serve, of myrmidonian race
  one ship convey'd us from our native place
  polyctor is my sire, an honour'd name,
  old like thyself, and not unknown to fame
  of seven his sons, by whom the lot was cast
  to serve our prince, it fell on me, the last.
  to watch this quarter, my adventure falls
  for with the morn the greeks attack your walls
  sleepless they sit, impatient to engage,
  and scarce their rulers check their martial rage.
   if then thou art of stern pelides' train,
   the mournful monarch thus rejoin'd again,
  ah tell me truly, where, oh! where are laid
  my son's dear relics? what befals him dead?
  have dogs dismember'd  on the naked plains ,
  or yet unmangled rest, his cold remains?
   o favour'd of the skies!  thus answered then
  the power that mediates between god and men
  nor dogs nor vultures have thy hector rent,
  but whole he lies, neglected in the tent
  this the twelfth evening since he rested there,
  untouch'd by worms, untainted by the air.
  still as aurora's ruddy beam is spread,
  round his friend's tomb achilles drags the dead
  yet undisfigured, or in limb or face,
  all fresh he lies, with every living grace,
  majestical in death! no stains are found
  o'er all the corse, and closed is every wound,
  though many a wound they gave. some heavenly care,
  some hand divine, preserves him ever fair
  or all the host of heaven, to whom he led
  a life so grateful, still regard him dead.
  thus spoke to priam the celestial guide,
  and joyful thus the royal sire replied
   blest is the man who pays the gods above
  the constant tribute of respect and love!
  those who inhabit the olympian bower
  my son forgot not, in exalted power
  and heaven, that every virtue bears in mind,
  even to the ashes of the just is kind.
  but thou, o generous youth! this goblet take,
  a pledge of gratitude for hector's sake
  and while the favouring gods our steps survey,
  safe to pelides' tent conduct my way.
  to whom the latent god   o king, forbear
  to tempt my youth, for apt is youth to err.
  but can i, absent from my prince's sight,
  take gifts in secret, that must shun the light?
  what from our master's interest thus we draw,
  is but a licensed theft that 'scapes the law.
  respecting him, my soul abjures the offence
  and as the crime, i dread the consequence.
  thee, far as argos, pleased i could convey
  guard of thy life, and partner of thy way
  on thee attend, thy safety to maintain,
  o'er pathless forests, or the roaring main.
  he said, then took the chariot at a bound,
  and snatch'd the reins, and whirl'd the lash around
  before the inspiring god that urged them on,
  the coursers fly with spirit not their own.
  and now they reach'd the naval walls, and found
  the guards repasting, while the bowls go round
  on these the virtue of his wand he tries,
  and pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes
  then heaved the massy gates, removed the bars,
  and o'er the trenches led the rolling cars.
  unseen, through all the hostile camp they went,
  and now approach'd pelides' lofty tent.
  on firs the roof was raised, and cover'd o'er
  with reeds collected from the marshy shore
  and, fenced with palisades, a hall of state,
   the work of soldiers,  where the hero sat.
  large was the door, whose well-compacted strength
  a solid pine-tree barr'd of wondrous length
  scarce three strong greeks could lift its mighty weight,
  but great achilles singly closed the gate.
  this hermes  such the power of gods  set wide
  then swift alighted the celestial guide,
  and thus reveal'd-- hear, prince! and understand
  thou ow'st thy guidance to no mortal hand
  hermes i am, descended from above,
  the king of arts, the messenger of jove,
  farewell  to shun achilles' sight i fly
  uncommon are such favours of the sky,
  nor stand confess'd to frail mortality.
  now fearless enter, and prefer thy prayers
  adjure him by his father's silver hairs,
  his son, his mother! urge him to bestow
  whatever pity that stern heart can know.
  thus having said, he vanish'd from his eyes,
  and in a moment shot into the skies
  the king, confirm'd from heaven, alighted there,
  and left his aged herald on the car,
  with solemn pace through various rooms he went,
  and found achilles in his inner tent
  there sat the hero  alcimus the brave,
  and great automedon, attendance gave
  these served his person at the royal feast
  around, at awful distance, stood the rest.
  unseen by these, the king his entry made
  and, prostrate now before achilles laid,
  sudden  a venerable sight!  appears
  embraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears
  those direful hands his kisses press'd, embrued
  even with the best, the dearest of his blood!
  as when a wretch  who, conscious of his crime,
  pursued for murder, flies his native clime
  just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,
  all gaze, all wonder  thus achilles gazed
  thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise
  all mute, yet seem'd to question with their eyes
  each look'd on other, none the silence broke,
  till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke
   ah think, thou favour'd of the powers divine!
  think of thy father's age, and pity mine!
  in me that father's reverend image trace,
  those silver hairs, that venerable face
  his trembling limbs, his helpless person, see!
  in all my equal, but in misery!
  yet now, perhaps, some turn of human fate
  expels him helpless from his peaceful state
  think, from some powerful foe thou seest him fly,
  and beg protection with a feeble cry.
  yet still one comfort in his soul may rise
  he hears his son still lives to glad his eyes,
  and, hearing, still may hope a better day
  may send him thee, to chase that foe away.
  no comfort to my griefs, no hopes remain,
  the best, the bravest, of my sons are slain!
  yet what a race! ere greece to ilion came,
  the pledge of many a loved and loving dame
  nineteen one mother bore--dead, all are dead!
  how oft, alas! has wretched priam bled!
  still one was left their loss to recompense
  his father's hope, his country's last defence.
  him too thy rage has slain! beneath thy steel,
  unhappy in his country's cause he fell!
   for him through hostile camps i bent my way,
  for him thus prostrate at thy feet i lay
  large gifts proportion'd to thy wrath i bear
  o hear the wretched, and the gods revere!
   think of thy father, and this face behold!
  see him in me, as helpless and as old!
  though not so wretched  there he yields to me,
  the first of men in sovereign misery!
  thus forced to kneel, thus grovelling to embrace
  the scourge and ruin of my realm and race
  suppliant my children's murderer to implore,
  and kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!
  these words soft pity in the chief inspire,
  touch'd with the dear remembrance of his sire.
  then with his hand  as prostrate still he lay
  the old man's cheek he gently turn'd away.
  now each by turns indulged the gush of woe
  and now the mingled tides together flow
  this low on earth, that gently bending o'er
  a father one, and one a son deplore
  but great achilles different passions rend,
  and now his sire he mourns, and now his friend.
  the infectious softness through the heroes ran
  one universal solemn shower began
  they bore as heroes, but they felt as man.
  satiate at length with unavailing woes,
  from the high throne divine achilles rose
  the reverend monarch by the hand he raised
  on his white beard and form majestic gazed,
  not unrelenting  then serene began
  with words to soothe the miserable man
   alas, what weight of anguish hast thou known,
  unhappy prince! thus guardless and alone
  two pass through foes, and thus undaunted face
  the man whose fury has destroy'd thy race!
  heaven sure has arm'd thee with a heart of steel,
  a strength proportion'd to the woes you feel.
  rise, then  let reason mitigate your care
  to mourn avails not  man is born to bear.
  such is, alas! the gods' severe decree
  they, only they are blest, and only free.
  two urns by jove's high throne have ever stood,
  the source of evil one, and one of good
  from thence the cup of mortal man he fills,
  blessings to these, to those distributes ill
  to most he mingles both  the wretch decreed
  to taste the bad unmix'd, is cursed indeed
  pursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven,
  he wanders, outcast both of earth and heaven.
  the happiest taste not happiness sincere
  but find the cordial draught is dash'd with care.
  who more than peleus shone in wealth and power
  what stars concurring bless'd his natal hour!
  a realm, a goddess, to his wishes given
  graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven.
  one evil yet o'ertakes his latest day
  no race succeeding to imperial sway
  an only son  and he, alas! ordain'd
  to fall untimely in a foreign land.
  see him, in troy, the pious care decline
  of his weak age, to live the curse of thine!
  thou too, old man, hast happier days beheld
  in riches once, in children once excell'd
  extended phrygia own'd thy ample reign,
  and all fair lesbos' blissful seats contain,
  and all wide hellespont's unmeasured main.
  but since the god his hand has pleased to turn,
  and fill thy measure from his bitter urn,
  what sees the sun, but hapless heroes' falls?
  war, and the blood of men, surround thy walls!
  what must be, must be. bear thy lot, nor shed
  these unavailing sorrows o'er the dead
  thou canst not call him from the stygian shore,
  but thou, alas! may'st live to suffer more!
  to whom the king   o favour'd of the skies!
  here let me grow to earth! since hector lies
  on the bare beach deprived of obsequies.
  o give me hector! to my eyes restore
  his corse, and take the gifts  i ask no more.
  thou, as thou may'st, these boundless stores enjoy
  safe may'st thou sail, and turn thy wrath from troy
  so shall thy pity and forbearance give
  a weak old man to see the light and live!
   move me no more,  achilles thus replies,
  while kindling anger sparkled in his eyes,
  nor seek by tears my steady soul to bend
  to yield thy hector i myself intend
  for know, from jove my goddess-mother came,
   old ocean's daughter, silver-footed dame,
  nor comest thou but by heaven  nor comest alone,
  some god impels with courage not thy own
  no human hand the weighty gates unbarr'd,
  nor could the boldest of our youth have dared
  to pass our outworks, or elude the guard.
  cease  lest, neglectful of high jove's command,
  i show thee, king! thou tread'st on hostile land
  release my knees, thy suppliant arts give o'er,
  and shake the purpose of my soul no more.
  the sire obey'd him, trembling and o'eraw'd.
  achilles, like a lion, rush'd abroad
  automedon and alcimus attend,
   whom most he honour'd, since he lost his friend,
  these to unyoke the mules and horses went,
  and led the hoary herald to the tent
  next, heap'd on high, the numerous presents bear,
   great hector's ransom,  from the polish'd car.
  two splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,
  they leave  to cover and enwrap the dead.
  then call the handmaids, with assistant toil
  to wash the body and anoint with oil,
  apart from priam  lest the unhappy sire,
  provoked to passion, once more rouse to ire
  the stern pelides  and nor sacred age,
  nor jove's command, should check the rising rage.
  this done, the garments o'er the corse they spread
  achilles lifts it to the funeral bed
  then, while the body on the car they laid,
  he groans, and calls on loved patroclus' shade
   if, in that gloom which never light must know,
  the deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below,
  o friend! forgive me, that i thus fulfil
   restoring hector  heaven's unquestion'd will.
  the gifts the father gave, be ever thine,
  to grace thy manes, and adorn thy shrine.
  he said, and, entering, took his seat of state
  where full before him reverend priam sate
  to whom, composed, the godlike chief begun
   lo! to thy prayer restored, thy breathless son
  extended on the funeral couch he lies
  and soon as morning paints the eastern skies,
  the sight is granted to thy longing eyes
  but now the peaceful hours of sacred night
  demand reflection, and to rest invite
  nor thou, o father! thus consumed with woe,
  the common cares that nourish life forego.
  not thus did niobe, of form divine,
  a parent once, whose sorrows equall'd thine
  six youthful sons, as many blooming maids,
  in one sad day beheld the stygian shades
  those by apollo's silver bow were slain,
  these, cynthia's arrows stretch'd upon the plain
  so was her pride chastised by wrath divine,
  who match'd her own with bright latona's line
  but two the goddess, twelve the queen enjoy'd
  those boasted twelve, the avenging two destroy'd.
  steep'd in their blood, and in the dust outspread,
  nine days, neglected, lay exposed the dead
  none by to weep them, to inhume them none
   for jove had turn'd the nation all to stone.
  the gods themselves, at length relenting gave
  the unhappy race the honours of a grave.
  herself a rock  for such was heaven's high will
  through deserts wild now pours a weeping rill
  where round the bed whence achelous springs,
  the watery fairies dance in mazy rings
  there high on sipylus's shaggy brow,
  she stands, her own sad monument of woe
  the rock for ever lasts, the tears for ever flow.
   such griefs, o king! have other parents known
  remember theirs, and mitigate thy own.
  the care of heaven thy hector has appear'd,
  nor shall he lie unwept, and uninterr'd
  soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown'd,
  and all the eyes of ilion stream around.
  he said, and, rising, chose the victim ewe
  with silver fleece, which his attendants slew.
  the limbs they sever from the reeking hide,
  with skill prepare them, and in parts divide
  each on the coals the separate morsels lays,
  and, hasty, snatches from the rising blaze.
  with bread the glittering canisters they load,
  which round the board automedon bestow'd.
  the chief himself to each his portion placed,
  and each indulging shared in sweet repast.
  when now the rage of hunger was repress'd,
  the wondering hero eyes his royal guest
  no less the royal guest the hero eyes,
  his godlike aspect and majestic size
  here, youthful grace and noble fire engage
  and there, the mild benevolence of age.
  thus gazing long, the silence neither broke,
   a solemn scene!  at length the father spoke
   permit me now, beloved of jove! to steep
  my careful temples in the dew of sleep
  for, since the day that number'd with the dead
  my hapless son, the dust has been my bed
  soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes
  my only food, my sorrows and my sighs!
  till now, encouraged by the grace you give,
  i share thy banquet, and consent to live.
  with that, achilles bade prepare the bed,
  with purple soft and shaggy carpets spread
  forth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way,
  and place the couches, and the coverings lay.
  then he   now, father, sleep, but sleep not here
  consult thy safety, and forgive my fear,
  lest any argive, at this hour awake,
  to ask our counsel, or our orders take,
  approaching sudden to our open'd tent,
  perchance behold thee, and our grace prevent.
  should such report thy honour'd person here,
  the king of men the ransom might defer
  but say with speed, if aught of thy desire
  remains unask'd  what time the rites require
  to inter thy hector? for, so long we stay
  our slaughtering arm, and bid the hosts obey.
   if then thy will permit  the monarch said
  to finish all due honours to the dead,
  this of thy grace accord  to thee are known
  the fears of ilion, closed within her town
  and at what distance from our walls aspire
  the hills of ide, and forests for the fire.
  nine days to vent our sorrows i request,
  the tenth shall see the funeral and the feast
  the next, to raise his monument be given
  the twelfth we war, if war be doom'd by heaven!
   this thy request  replied the chief  enjoy
  till then our arms suspend the fall of troy.
  then gave his hand at parting, to prevent
  the old man's fears, and turn'd within the tent
  where fair briseis, bright in blooming charms,
  expects her hero with desiring arms.
  but in the porch the king and herald rest
  sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast.
  now gods and men the gifts of sleep partake
  industrious hermes only was awake,
  the king's return revolving in his mind,
  to pass the ramparts, and the watch to blind.
  the power descending hover'd o'er his head
   and sleep'st thou, father!  thus the vision said
  now dost thou sleep, when hector is restored?
  nor fear the grecian foes, or grecian lord?
  thy presence here should stern atrides see,
  thy still surviving sons may sue for thee
  may offer all thy treasures yet contain,
  to spare thy age  and offer all in vain.
  waked with the word the trembling sire arose,
  and raised his friend  the god before him goes
  he joins the mules, directs them with his hand,
  and moves in silence through the hostile land.
  when now to xanthus' yellow stream they drove,
   xanthus, immortal progeny of jove,
  the winged deity forsook their view,
  and in a moment to olympus flew.
  now shed aurora round her saffron ray,
  sprang through the gates of light, and gave the day
  charged with the mournful load, to ilion go
  the sage and king, majestically slow.
  cassandra first beholds, from ilion's spire,
  the sad procession of her hoary sire
  then, as the pensive pomp advanced more near,
   her breathless brother stretched upon the bier,
  a shower of tears o'erflows her beauteous eyes,
  alarming thus all ilion with her cries
   turn here your steps, and here your eyes employ,
  ye wretched daughters, and ye sons of troy!
  if e'er ye rush'd in crowds, with vast delight,
  to hail your hero glorious from the fight,
  now meet him dead, and let your sorrows flow
  your common triumph, and your common woe.
  in thronging crowds they issue to the plains
  nor man nor woman in the walls remains
  in every face the self-same grief is shown
  and troy sends forth one universal groan.
  at scaea's gates they meet the mourning wain,
  hang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain.
  the wife and mother, frantic with despair,
  kiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter'd hair
  thus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay
  and there had sigh'd and sorrow'd out the day
  but godlike priam from the chariot rose
   forbear  he cried  this violence of woes
  first to the palace let the car proceed,
  then pour your boundless sorrows o'er the dead.
  the waves of people at his word divide,
  slow rolls the chariot through the following tide
  even to the palace the sad pomp they wait
  they weep, and place him on the bed of state.
  a melancholy choir attend around,
  with plaintive sighs, and music's solemn sound
  alternately they sing, alternate flow
  the obedient tears, melodious in their woe.
  while deeper sorrows groan from each full heart,
  and nature speaks at every pause of art.
  first to the corse the weeping consort flew
  around his neck her milk-white arms she threw,
   and oh, my hector! oh, my lord!  she cries
  snatch'd in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!
  thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!
  and i abandon'd, desolate, alone!
  an only son, once comfort of our pains,
  sad product now of hapless love, remains!
  never to manly age that son shall rise,
  or with increasing graces glad my eyes
  for ilion now  her great defender slain
  shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.
  who now protects her wives with guardian care?
  who saves her infants from the rage of war?
  now hostile fleets must waft those infants o'er
   those wives must wait them  to a foreign shore
  thou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,
  the sad companion of thy mother's woe
  driven hence a slave before the victor's sword
  condemn'd to toil for some inhuman lord
  or else some greek whose father press'd the plain,
  or son, or brother, by great hector slain,
  in hector's blood his vengeance shall enjoy,
  and hurl thee headlong from the towers of troy.
  for thy stern father never spared a foe
  thence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!
  thence many evils his sad parents bore,
  his parents many, but his consort more.
  why gav'st thou not to me thy dying hand?
  and why received not i thy last command?
  some word thou would'st have spoke, which, sadly dear,
  my soul might keep, or utter with a tear
  which never, never could be lost in air,
  fix'd in my heart, and oft repeated there!
  thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,
  her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.
  the mournful mother next sustains her part
   o thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!
  of all my race thou most by heaven approved,
  and by the immortals even in death beloved!
  while all my other sons in barbarous bands
  achilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,
  this felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,
  free, and a hero, to the stygian coast.
  sentenced, 'tis true, by his inhuman doom,
  thy noble corse was dragg'd around the tomb
   the tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain
  ungenerous insult, impotent and vain!
  yet glow'st thou fresh with every living grace
  no mark of pain, or violence of face
  rosy and fair! as phoebus' silver bow
  dismiss'd thee gently to the shades below.
  thus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.
  sad helen next in pomp of grief appears
  fast from the shining sluices of her eyes
  fall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.
   ah, dearest friend! in whom the gods had join'd
  tne mildest manners with the bravest mind,
  now twice ten years  unhappy years  are o'er
  since paris brought me to the trojan shore,
   o had i perish'd, ere that form divine
  seduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!
  yet was it ne'er my fate, from thee to find
  a deed ungentle, or a word unkind.
  when others cursed the authoress of their woe,
  thy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow.
  if some proud brother eyed me with disdain,
  or scornful sister with her sweeping train,
  thy gentle accents soften'd all my pain.
  for thee i mourn, and mourn myself in thee,
  the wretched source of all this misery.
  the fate i caused, for ever i bemoan
  sad helen has no friend, now thou art gone!
  through troy's wide streets abandon'd shall i roam!
  in troy deserted, as abhorr'd at home!
  so spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.
  distressful beauty melts each stander-by.
  on all around the infectious sorrow grows
  but priam check'd the torrent as it rose
   perform, ye trojans! what the rites require,
  and fell the forests for a funeral pyre
  twelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread
  achilles grants these honours to the dead.
  he spoke, and, at his word, the trojan train
  their mules and oxen harness to the wain,
  pour through the gates, and fell'd from ida's crown,
  roll back the gather'd forests to the town.
  these toils continue nine succeeding days,
  and high in air a sylvan structure raise.
  but when the tenth fair morn began to shine,
  forth to the pile was borne the man divine,
  and placed aloft  while all, with streaming eyes,
  beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise.
  soon as aurora, daughter of the dawn,
  with rosy lustre streak'd the dewy lawn,
  again the mournful crowds surround the pyre,
  and quench with wine the yet remaining fire.
  the snowy bones his friends and brothers place
   with tears collected  in a golden vase
  the golden vase in purple palls they roll'd,
  of softest texture, and inwrought with gold.
  last o'er the urn the sacred earth they spread,
  and raised the tomb, memorial of the dead.
   strong guards and spies, till all the rites were done,
  watch'd from the rising to the setting sun.
  all troy then moves to priam's court again,
  a solemn, silent, melancholy train
  assembled there, from pious toil they rest,
  and sadly shared the last sepulchral feast.
  such honours ilion to her hero paid,
  and peaceful slept the mighty hector's shade.
